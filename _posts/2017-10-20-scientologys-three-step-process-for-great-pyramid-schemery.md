excerpt: "Scientology's goal? To market specific terms and key phrases to the
target as the salvation to their inquisition -- which is how you plant
your knowledge of word-clear locutionary phrases. Then, you can use
metaphorical witch-pricking tactics to see how the target responds to
key phrases. This indicates whether your mind control tactics and
hypnotic suggestion works or not -- by eliciting darting eyes and
'knowing' glances. Great job guys: remember to suggest specific means
of abusing confirmation bias in the minds of those who surround the
target.

This all allows you to mitigate risk, cast blame with inception,
gaslight you -- while leaving zero evidence -- all while you *think*
you are cooperating with something.  Meanwhile, you abuse suggestion,
casual interactions and social media tactics similar to
spear-phishing. Ensure the target is *already* sociophysically
isolated, so they will run from the current 'bad cops' straight to
your 'good cop.' Dynamically alter who is a source of positive &
negative energy in this isolated target's life."

This is the same kind of torment that lower classes and lower castes
have been enduring for centuries, now empowered by surveillance and
the technological transformation of society.

#### T.I. (Target Individual): Watchu Know About That?

#### (T.I. Is Not A Scientologist. The Initials Are Coincidental.)

Ask a celebrity scientologist if they understand any of this: I
guarantee they are logistically containerized from it. If so, their
most important members are always shielded from the true inner
workings of the religion. Why? Because they would run out screaming.

All of this is easy -- well, not easy, it **requires** a network,
otherwise you only have the knowledge you need to defend yourself --
It's not hard to be used by one of these networks, albeit you need to
be a bit wieldy with more malice than I am comfortable of entertaining
in my heart. I'm not sure everyone involved understood who, what,
where and why.

I guess if it's not true, then it really doesn't matter so much, does
it? Well if it is true, it matters a lot because these corrosive
assholes have infiltrated law enforcement and all kinds of structures
in the federal government.

# [Strategy Unclear: Mastery Over *Tactical Rhetoric* & *Pervasive Hypnosis*](#strategy-unclear-mastery-over-tactical-rhetoric-and-pervasive-hypnosis)

A quick discussion of long-winded rhetorical *tactics* first requires
some definitions.

<a name="locution" />

### [Locution](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/locution)

> *(1) A phrase or expression connected to an individual or a group of
> individuals through repeated usage. (2) The use of a word or phrase
> in an unusual or specialized way. (3) A supernatural revelation
> where a religious figure, statue or icon speaks, usually to a
> saint.*

<a name="circumlocution" />

### [Circumlocution](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/circumlocution#English)

> *(5) A roundabout or indirect way of speaking; the use of more words
> than necessary to express an idea.*

This is tactic useful when on wiretap, but only when risk greatly
outweighs fear. Interrogation tactics necessitate that some ideas
emerge from the target or suspect, usually a suspect. That is, to be
confident of what's on their mind, without being vulnerable to
accusations that you used suggestion and inception, you must get them
to say it or think it *first*.

#### Paul Says "Don't; Churn The Butter!"

![Why Churn The Butter?](/img/posts/2017-10-20-scientologys-three-step-process-for-great-pyramid-schemery/dont-churn-the-butter.jpg)

Circumlocution increases the quantity of content tangential to some
topic or idea that must emerge *from the target*. It is also useful
for "interrogation sessions" -- viz. programming sessions with
surveillance-fueled covert hypnosis.

<a name="illocution" />

### [Illocution](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/illocution)

> *(1) The aim of a speaker in making an utterance as opposed to the
> meaning of the terms used. (linguistics)*

When gaslighting, you need to stand in the middle, acting as a
differential gear, intentionally distranslating meanings to all
parties involved.  The illusions must be coherent, so allusions must
be defined and conveyed to the "interrogated" party. This takes time,
planning, effort and an unforgivable amount of malice.

#### The Differential Gear: a Metaphor For Manipulation By A Third Party

<a name="allocution" />

### [Allocution](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/allocution):

> *(5) The mode of information dissemination in which media broadcasts
> are transmitted to multiple receivers with no or very limited
> capability of a two-way exchange of information.*

Allocution herein implies one-way authority: you are being "told" yet
perhaps don't know why someone might claim to have authority. You are
constantly discouraged from asking direct questions: *always use a
cover*. Why? What if I don't trust *you* and don't understand why this
is happening?

#### Who Is That Authority? It Could Be CIA, FBI, Mafia, SMERSH? How The Fuck Would I know?

![Smersh](/img/posts/2017-10-20-scientologys-three-step-process-for-great-pyramid-schemery/smersh.jpg)

<a name="perlocution" />

### [Perlocution](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/perlocution)

> *(1) The effect the terms used by a speaker can have on another
> speaker and their emotions and responses. (linguistics)*

All people and groups have their own connotations of words, images and
languages. Quickly and simply acquiescing an understanding of an
individuals perlocution is critical. Otherwise, how do you distort
words and images, so that the same message is projected to many
people, but interpreted by handfuls of those people in various ways?
Long-winded conversation with the target, suggestion and
circumlocution until target latches onto symbols.

To minimize risk and liability, these perlocutionary programming
sessions need to be conducted with a few people *in the know*, while
others are visually, auditorially and socially blocked out unable --
they're just not on site or it's in a room away from social
contact. If someone only works at night, these people get paid
administrative overtime to torture you. Also, you can front like the
people are doing this out of pity or goodwill -- they're hanging out
with a pariah, who just might be a tragic charity case.

> *Uh huh... Says who? No, really, who says I'm a charity case?* Oh,
> you mean they wanted me to think this was the freaking **Make-A-Wish
> Foundation?** Holy fuck!

Dungeons & Dragons sessions, while they are usually a lot of fun, also
can provide the perfect cover for hypnotic suggestion: they are
regular, they last long, the characters can deviate from their roles
to say whatever they want. If you feel you're isolated and that your
recent social interactions are constricted to 5 our less people: if
they promise you fulfilling social engagement, but always indirectly
make you feel anxious, miserable and emotioanlly negative, then you
need to find new friends. If no one is around to see how this happens,
they speak in language that is only emotionally relevant to you, seem
to have access to information obtained via surveillance, *RUN!* That's
a sociophysical dungeon.

To expand your teams capacity for distranslation, *constant
surveillance is critical* to inform your team's assessment of the
target's perlocution. What would really help? If you already know that
target individual talks to himself or herself, while ruminating in
emotional response to society-wide dejection you have created, *then
isn't that _convenient_?* As a learned response to years of
mistreatment, abusive relationships and ruthlessly extinguished
sympathy, this provide a high-density of content you can leverage for
gaslighting.

If the targeted individual is aware of occult techniques and magickal
thinking, this makes it easy to use suggestion to get them to alter
their metaprogramming to perceive nearly every interaction as
potentially conveying many messages. Simply imply that there's
something between the lines you want to convey to them and, if they
understand occult techniques, they may spark up a taxing background
process in their minds, convoking it every time they interact with
someone new who *seems to "know"*. Almost no one is actually
intelligent enough to leverage magickal protocols for communication
under the radar -- at least, not without constant contact and shared
experiences of initiation. Nor would most people actually care enough
about the target to carefully plan all their interactions to be
layered with constant occult techniques.

#### Imagine Using A Cattle Prod -- In This Situation

![Cattle Prod Factory Farm](/img/posts/2017-10-20-scientologys-three-step-process-for-great-pyramid-schemery/cattle-prod.png)

If you, as the chief inquisitors, discover this, you can simply mimic
those magickal techniques to gain their trust, distranslate or confuse
them. Then, simply spur the target on by shocking them with persisten
emotional trauma and -- *voila* -- they talk to themselves about
it. Giving you "leads" to expand your horrific pyramid scheme torture
and *borderline* slavery.

Further to the *point*, these magickal thinking techniques encourage
the target to diffuse their brainpower, energy and time by redirecting
it towards solving puzzles that were always ultimately trivial.
Occasionally interesting, but usually led somewhere via chain of
inferences towards *locutionary* words and images that could be used
to smear me and justify continued distreatment.

There were so many trivial exercises that it became clear they only
ever intended to confuse me, provoking me into talking to others about
the signals I try to process in casual interactions. Overutilization
of magickal thinking can lead to thought disorder. If it does, it will
ultimately lead to mental illness or at least a diagnosis. Another
objective: throw the dissident in a mental institution. Lock them up
and throw away the keys. This is why those using occult psychology
leverage metasyntactical on & off buttons -- so their neophytes don't
drive themselves crazy.

At the [Colab](http://www.colabroanoke.com/), it became obvious no one
would want to or be allowed to found a business with me without being
tormented themselves. Call me crazy, see if I care: everyone already
thinks I'm crazy. Whatever this stuff is, it smells bad to other
people, like a dying animal -- *AND IT DOES NOT WASH OFF!*

### &#9312; [Alter The Energetic Dynamics Of An Individual's Adjacent Sociophyscial Circuitry](#alter-the-energetic-dynamics-of-an-individuals-adjacent-sociophysical-circuitry)

Simply identify an individual's 1&deg; & 2&deg social boundary. Target
the individuals in the boundary, project disinformation, use
percutionary NLP to alter the frames of their friends and family and,
for a finishing touch, abuse covert hypnosis[^metasyntactic-ability]
without regard for the widespread damage you do to society. Bastardize
linguistics[^metaphoneme-inventory] by randomly remapping

to **consent** to _psychological rape_.

### &#9313; [Scapegoat & Brainwash The Target and Any Bystanders](#scapegoat-and-brainwash-the-target-and-any-bystanders)

Ensure your victims never question anything by abusing illocutionary
allocution: they must believe they are complicit in "this" -- whatever
this might be -- and so they should mute everything they might say.
You're permitted to abuse circumlocution to stimulate conversation
covering adjacent topics and key phrases, perhaps insinuating
knowledge & intent -- perhaps not, but it's on wiretap?

Your goal? To market specific terms and key phrases to the target as
the salvation to their inquisition -- which is how you plant your
knowledge of word-clear locutionary phrases. Then, you can use
metaphorical [pricking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pricking)
tactics to see how the target responds to key phrases. This indicates
whether your mind control tactics and hypnotic suggestion works or not
-- by eliciting darting eyes and "knowing" glances. Great job guys:
remember to suggest specific means of abusing confirmation bias in the
minds of those who surround the target.

This all allows you to mitigate risk, cast blame with inception,
gaslight you -- while leaving zero evidence -- all while you *think*
you are cooperating with something.  Meanwhile, you abuse suggestion,
casual interactions and social media tactics similar to
spear-phishing. Ensure the target is *already* sociophysically
isolated, so they will run from the current "bad cops" straight to
your "good cop." Dynamically alter who is a source of positive &
negative energy in this isolated target's life.

Eventually they instill stockholm syndrome for the upsell of removing
the Thetans YOU created. Fuck your pattern lanugage. You assholes
create the evil you charge people to "audit" to clean up. They
believe it works because then you interject anonymized energy, harming
the lives the frenemies who may have caused that person's "thetanic"
ills.

> "Satanic" ... Cat got your tongue... ?

If ever all else fails, then if you've maintained consistent
operational tactics moving forward, you can just scapegoat the target.
Easy peasy.

### &#9314; [From All The Tasty, Extrapyramidal Carnage: Profit!](#from-all-the-tasty-extrapyramidal-carnage-profit)

This perpetuates the monetizable pyramid scheme. Upon attaining
critical mass of the network effect, it becomes cheap projecting
energy through decentralized hierarchies of catspaws. Any religion
must give its followers a mission. Any information collected in
"auditing" sessions becomes fodder for open season on fair game, the
best hunting and fishing for growing the network.

If I didn't know that &#9312; occult techniques would have always
proliferated across the internet and &#9313; would be inevitably used
against anyone and everyone, then I would say: `Don't even
accidentally wander into this.` However, knowing what I do now -- in
context with the tendency of superconnected internet to foment
metaphysical precipitation -- I believe people should be woken up and
trained in

### [Remapped Universal Semiotics, Metaphonology and Metasyntactic Variables](#remapped-universal-semiotics-metaphonology-and-metasyntactic-variables)

Metasyntactic variables are one possibility for that on/off switch
mentioned above -- think the
[SAX algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML) for
stream processed XML parsing. To understand the meaning, you have to
be initiated. Otherwise, you will be identified and they will lead you
away from the true meaning, until you stop following or you go
insane. I've been targeted by these *groups* or people using these
tactics for years, but I really have no idea which *groups*.

It took me forever to figure out what this means: !@#$'ing
nothing... unless they semiotically map it to a "key" on your "control
interface." There are countably many semiotic signifiers related to
the human experience that can be mapped, for which a Zipf's
distribution can be generated: these primarily map to cultural
universals, most generic hand-signs or most frequent body language.

By the time you know that Scientology wants to get involved in your
life, it's way too late. They have likely already invested in
compromising your social boundary. You are better off fleeing to
another country. Or you might be safe on Mars. If these people have a
problem with you they will never talk to you about it: that's pretty
simple, isn't it? This planet moves forward together -- I wanted to
make one goddamn point about disconnection and I didn't actually want
anything to happen.

I'm almost certain I won't be having children in America. I've been
led this for years now, especially since 2011. In 2007, I thought a
lot about why Jesus didn't have children: because the first thing they
will go for are the people and facets of life you love most. If you
threaten them in some real way, they will take away everything. In
this tragic regard, I got lucky: I wasn't old enough to have familial
or financial liabilities.

### [I Became Voluntarily Celibate Out Of Sheer Terror](#i-became-voluntarily-celibate-out-of-sheer-terror)

If you truly care about changing the world, keep your dick in your
pants. They will go for: your jobs, your career, your vehicles, your
dignity, your extended family, your children, your life. If you want
to change things, you have to be willing to lose all of that **and
capable of justifying it**. Would Jesus ever have been capable of
justifying getting his children targeted? No. He didn't have that. And
you have to take these losses in stride: because when you show that
you hurt, they use that to claim that you are weak.
