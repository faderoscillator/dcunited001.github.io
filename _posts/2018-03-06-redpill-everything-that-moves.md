# [Oh, I'm A Hypocrite?](#oh-im-a-hypocrite)

In my life, people have a way with words. They get to say that "David
Conner's never done anything else for anyone but himself." Why?
Because it's true: in almost my entire adult life, I have never
possessed sufficient social or financial resources to give back to
anyone. I possess merely information and what good does information do
for anyone else when no one's allowed to acknowledge your identity?

Would they ever care about helping me attain some position, where free
from being under someone else's thumb, so that I can accumulate
sociophysical resources to contribute to someone else's life? It
depends on who you're asking, but yes, almost everyone would say "Yes,
we'd love to help David Conner." However, do they ever follow through?
My family refuses to read anything I ever write -- ALWAYS claiming
that they don't understand it, while at the same time, NEVER being
willing to listen to me explain it to them in less complicated
language. I can tell they don't read anything I write because their
**impetulant, facile arguments** to justify depriving me of all
opportunity *NEVER reference any ideas I project*. Literally ZERO
information that comes out of my mouth finds itself as
*[material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materiality_(law))* to any
propositions in their arguments. It's because they are objectively bad
listeners when it comes to listening to David Conner. Why? Because
just like with everyone else, my existence and all informational
associated to my identity is inconvenient to their understanding of
reality. The lies people around me tell themselves to make themselves
feel better about my psychological abuse fall to pieces if they
internalize any information in my arguments.

<a name="what-was-the-start-of-all-this" />

### [What Was The Start Of All This](#what-was-the-start-of-all-this)

I don't actually care about who's fault it is. I don't want to blame
my family, but when I write, I'm writing for two reasons. First, no
one listens to me. And secondly, it is inefficient for me to talk
about my problems and my passions, but when I write, my words have the
potential to multiply with zero effort required on my part. This yet
another reason why the people around me who seek to control me reacted
so negatively to my initial writing. It creates more information they
must clean up. However, these information-control-freaks -- *not my
family* -- never really expected me to recover from anything they've
done.

I don't expect my family to be interested in everything I write, but I
have been writing for three years about all the problems in my life,
specifically so that when I am shoved into a mental institution, I
will have a library of content that refutes all the fantastic bullshit
that has been said about me -- which does not primarily originate from
my family. Instead, it originates from people who seek to use my
family as vectors to control me by minimizing my social boundary --
the set of people I interact with regularly.

What's worse than never having done anything for anyone else? *Never
being permitted to accumulate good karma because you've been so
totally deprived of social interaction and financial resources.* So,
when people get to say "I've never done anything for anyone else" it's
because they don't let me out of my cage very often. And if the people
in my social boundary are more socially connected than I am, it means
that the negative information that they project predominantly
determines how everyone in society views me. I am literally in a
fucking social cage; I am sick and tired of being abused for my entire
adult life, when I want nothing other than to help people.

<a name="what-does-it-mean-to-be-memory-holed" />

### [What Does It Mean To Be Memory-Holed?](#what-does-it-mean-to-be-memory-holed)

While the [memory hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole) is
originally from 1984, it is not THE memory hole that I'm referring
to. The reference from 1984 is simply a metaphor for a more sinister
tactic of information control. It's incredibly effective for handling
waste that unfortunately came into contact with "classified"
information.

Being memory-holed essentially means that whenever someone comes into
contact with a targeted individual, they have bluepills shoved down
their throat until they either hate the target or forget that person
ever existed. Ideally, it ensures that no one will encounter you to
form memories that need to be scrubbed out later on. Whether it was
intentional at first is unclear, but I've been memory holed happened
for over 10 years now. i've experience a decade of this. It's called
being "Memory Holed" as in "Hold the memories, please." Basically, you
are socially isolated, so people accumulate minimal memories with you,
socially. This means that your adversaries have pre-emptively erased
you.

People develop emotional connections with each other gradually as they
spend time together. However, people are fickle and the strength of
the emotional connections we form fades quickly, as though friendships
are plants in a garden that need to be water with social
interaction. If you suffer in poverty, isolation or from complete
ignorance of social interactions, then you may be at a disadvantage
throughout life, before being intentionally memory-holed. For example,
you have Asperger's, you're broke because you're psychologically
tortured at work and now you have an attachment disorder to top it all
off.

The memory hole is only a tactic against valid targets, who must be
socially, financially and psychologically vulnerable. It won't work
against everyone, but where it does, it's incredibly effective. This
is why it's infuriating for me personally: it means that people
assessed my psychology and worked to cull me out of society, undermine
my career and seeded a bunch of personality disorders into my
psychology.

![Detainees Memories Are Classified](/img/posts/2018-02-14-to-catch-a-butterfly-epistemic-miracles-of-serendipity/classified-memories.jpg)

By the way, once you are sufficiently memory holed, you're already as
good as dead, those cigar-smoking men just haven't killed you
yet. Until they do, they seek to prevent other people from forming
memories about you, leveraging mob-style tactics to threaten everyone
close to you to handle your life details like it's literally
classified information. This is so that, after they act, they have
maximal flexibility with regard to telling the story about *your*
life. While they manage to restrict you socially, the volume of
memories created in the minds of other people created is minimized, so
there's a much lower chance of blowback occuring after they act
against you. This isn't true of everyone memory holed, but it takes a
lot of thumbscrews to get people to handle a loved one in this way, so
after they've committed to engaging a target in this way for a
sufficent amount of time, they do not back off.

If you have any doubts as to what the memory hole is, check out [this
youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSSY_i136tw)
instructing children to ignore the talking turkey at
Thanksgiving. It's a video from our friends at the [Memory Hole
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNBGgrsyZCmcsc18h6VJh_w) on
YouTube, chock full of videos which are like metaphorical instruction
manuals for psychological torture techniques. Fun for you and the
whole family ... except for that one kid under the table, but! What's
that?! I think I heard a turkey talking. Turkey's don't talk, do they?

### [Thread-Killing: The NSA Effectively Memory-Holes Targeted Individuals By Dissappearing Content They Interact With](#thread-killing-the-nsa-effecively-memory-holes-targeted-individuals)

This you can prove with sophisticated data analytics. The set of
targeted individuals can be identified automatically by combing
through social media data to identify people who are *almost always
the last commenters* on a Facebook thread. This acts as a statistical
signature *created by your own attempts to censor, isolate and target
political dissidents.* Thanks, Obama, and I mean it!

Step two: cross reference this list of potential targets with data
mined from LinkedIn that describes people whose social neighborhoods
share a coincidentally large number of targets. This is your list of
potential war criminals to investigate for mob-style tactics and
psychological torture in America. This is easier than you'd
think. Paradoxically, the logisitical coordination of intelligence
*intending to hide activity* ends up creating a signature that makes
it easier to identify in data. Why? Because intelligence handlers and
assets will be coordinated to double up their overlapping sets of
targets and reduce social visibility of their actions. This means that
the socially isolated targets will appear disproportionately
represented in the social neighborhoods of the
perpetrators. Furthermore, the most guilty perpetrators will be most
connected to the agencies driving this abuse: they will be connected
to each other's social neighborhoods and their LinkedIn data will
demonstrate previous work in intelligence or fields close to
intelligence.

This is no easy task, but there should be enough leads to identify
cases for further processing. These can be ironically identified
mostly from the puerile attempt to censor political dissidents, which
itself demonstrates cognizance.

How can a political dissident's interactions be automagically
deranked? DevOps is the most important organizational unit of a
corporation for the NSA to control. It's the only unit that is really
worth the potential blowback that would occur for the NSA to
insert/manipulate employees of a corporation. Compromise DevOps and
you might as well control everything that technology company does
online. Why? You can mess with the containerization of services
deployed to the technology companies cloud infrastructure. Combined
with the NSA's leverage over telecom's Route/Switch infrastructure to
surgically *and silently* reroute the traffic of dissidents --
particularly with regard to [BGP
exploits](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-3867/) -- you
leverage influence over DevOps can essentially launch application
servers and stream-processing servers to handle requests involving
data a dissident touched in very specific ways.

You can rerank entire shards of data that any dissident touches. That
comment thread? It's newsfeed rank is suddenly zero. This means that
*POOF!* the facebook thread your dissident just interacted with is no
longer seen by anyone that matters on Facebook. Or you can promote
shards of content to be marketed towards people who berate and
humiliate that person. Or you can screw with the matching algorithms
in online gaming to ensure that political dissidents are routed to
matches with people who audit the audio stream for references to
classified information -- or subject that person to simple hypnotic
techniques via audio.

There is a set of individuals in America whose days are numbered. They
are considered the radioactive waste products of intelligence
operations gone wrong. This set of individuals is completely
identifyable using publically accessible data, which is impossible to
cleanse to statistical satisfaction. Therefore, people in control of
the informational security [must be planning to purge it all at
once](http://localhost:4000/posts/2018-01-30-caelis-ruissent-avoiding-the-engineered-collapse.html):
they're not ignorant of their operational security
vulnerabilities. **This is but one of twenty different factors
indicating convergence towards a total system reset.**

It's this awareness OpSec weaknesses that drives American in command
of informational security to push for social engineering to avoid ever
creating these digitized data footprince in the first place. If they
can drive fear into the hearts of young Americans, they can dissuade
us from ever creating the digital artifacts that prove anything ever
happened. However, nothing that can be done now is good enough to
eliminate the footprint that already exists.

Facebook's production operations team has apparently hired many people
who used to work with the Navy in cyber-operations: they have the
clearances to work with NSA, though this is circumstantial. The point
is that, if you wanted to have access to Facebook's devops, you would
want to control the people who work in Facebook DevOps.

### [Redpill Everything That Moves](#my-life-is-a-rigged-game-redpill-everything-that-moves)

How is it paying off to have assassinated my career? If you hadn't
done that, I'd have been so fucking busy with my head down, I'd never
have become a philosopher, nor would I ever have the time to look at
so much information online. All your operations to control me have
backfired. All these people placed on me for security have been
incompetent at best, as they're incredibly susceptible to exactly the
kind of disinformation that's blinding this entire nation. At worst,
they've lied to you for job security in national security.

When I say I'm trying to stop a 21st century Holocaust, I'm not
kidding. This is what happens in any state that accumulates and marks
enough dissidents it considers to be threats.  The characteristics of
who was generally targeted by these operations will indicate who was
driving them. it's likely coming from all sides, honestly. However, it
pales in comparison to the human rights abuses in China and Russia,
though it certainly doesn't look good. Worst of all, the American
governtment couldn't let a single one of these cases be seen for what
it is. Why? *BECAUSE THAT TYPE OF ABUSE CAN'T BE WIDELY KNOWN TO
HAPPEN HERE IN AMERICA.* Typical.

Freedom of religion utlimately represents and individuals freedom over
their own beliefs. If you lose freedom of religion, you lose freedom
of belief. If individuals in America lose freedom to decide what they
do and do not believe, they have effectively lost the freedom of
religion.

<a name="my-life-is-a-rigged-game" />

### [My Life Is A Rigged Game](#my-life-is-a-rigged-game)

You get to never acknowledge anything positive about me, whether I'm
your friend, your family or a stranger you've been told to hate for as
long as you can remember, if that -- which is the intent of
memory-holing someone: to prevent an individuals in society from
thinking about that person or forming memories about them
whatsoever. If you deviate from the official story -- that I'm nothing
other than a drug-seeking, manipulative person completely devoid of
all value -- then any interactions with me will bring down upon you
the wrath of the intelligence community. You can only interact with me
if you *INTEND* negative consequences OR generally appear to have
strengthened the sources of my social isolation. It sounds crazy
doesn't it?

This is what it's like to be David Conner in America. Of course, the
people who have saught to socially limit me also assumed they could
create a bunch of negative consequences and then USE me as both a
scapegoat for a shitstorm they created as well as an example of what
happens to someone who leaks -- all while never telling me what I
could and could not talk about, ensuring that the consequences of my
ignorant actions would create problems of significant exposure.

#### J/K folks, that's not actually the napkin...

Everyone close to me and even people I've never met already know my
fate: I'm essentially not allowed to ever achieve anything in
America. I live inside a rigged game. No one was allowed to tell me
this. Why? During 2013, 2014 and 2015, I was easily controlled *and
predictable*. If I learned that my life is a rigged game, I would
become unpredictable. I'd respond in exactly they way these people
were afraid I would respond: I'd reorient my energy to accomplish
something different. While I was working on startup ideas, I was
essentially on a hamster wheel. I was under surveillance: as soon as I
started moving closer to my goals, people manipulated me and
situations around me to disrupt my
[velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_(software_development))
and
[traction](https://www.amazon.com/What-Every-Angel-Investor-Wants/dp/0071800719). Since
I was working on esoteric software, no one would understand anything I
did and all the source code I left behind would be worthless. With the
assistance of my handy-dandy terminal cynicism, I finally figured this
out. How did I respond?

Yeh, call me paranoid. I don't care; I never do anything with a
singular purpose or singular objective. I'm always aiming for more
than one bird with every stone I throw. it sounds crazy, but I
thought:

All of that has happened: except people have never changed the way
they look at me, as though I'm some worthless piece of shit stuck to
their shoe. It's because I live in a tightly managed, rigged
game. People seem to be compelled to treat me this way. Why? I don't
really care and I could be wrong about a lot of it. The "why" only
matters to me insofar as I can change my circumstances.




- informational baggage limits flexibility
- connect to rant on academic (et alias) gatekeepers
  - informational baggage making it "too inconvenient" for someone to
    be an investment
    - informational baggage: unrepentent drug use, etc.
    - people tend to think investing their energy in me would be a
      waste of their time because they assume that it's too easy for
      other people with authority -- academic, political and otherwise
      -- to tear me down.
  - however terrible and inconvenient details of my life story are,
    when i finally break free of these artificial sociophysical
    restraints placed on me by the weak and petty, it will be because
    i tore through everything used to hold me back with force of will
    and strength of mind.
    - at that point, everything that had been done to hold me back
      will fly back in the face of those people who sought to
      (mitigate me) by restraining me, gaslighting me and denying me
      all opportunities.
    - for example, people have sought to limit my exposure to
      academics and people with careers in technology. however,
      despite their vain attempts to prevent my ideas from escaping
      and to avoid exposing me to academic knowledge, in the end,
      these people merely serve to prove that my ideas are original,
      since no one except wikipedia and lonely nights could have
      helped me develop them.
      - therefore, their attempts to isolate me will backfire as this
        is just one aspect of my life experience or lack thereof which
        I will gladly use when the time is right.

### [Throwing Bambi To The Wolves By Forbidding Socioepistemic Information Acquisition](#throwing-bambi-to-the-wolves-by-forbidding-socioepistemic-information-aquisition)

*Whenever I engage in behaviors to discover the outlines of epistemic
structures -- viz. to socially inquire about the missing pieces to
explain why my life is a broken mess -- I am derided as a broken
schizophrenic mess that's clearly paranoid and needs to be stuck in a
mental institution forever*. Without skills for seeking and acquiring
socially relevant information, people are socially paralyzed. To be
sure, that's a fantastic vulnerability to breed if your objective is
to generally dominate people -- and if you ever want to make them feel
helpless, you can belittle them by calling them a lost puppy or a
one-trick pony -- while never giving them a clue, of course. Why?
Because America -- that's apparently why.

I was never equipped with these skill during my adolescence, but
afterwards everyone saught to ostracize me by meticulously
constricting my social experience, running the rumor mill at full
steam, fallaciously labelling me with mental illness, and figuring out
how to get my closest friends/family to do all the dirty work,
ensuring those relationships would be ruined. The most infuriating
part of all of this is knowing that **these
[dementors](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dementor%27s_Kiss)
depend on my social vulnerability to abuse me** because otherwise
they'd never be capable of doing this to someone without getting
caught doing it. Moreover, other people apparently bred social
vulnerability into my psychology TO USE ME, who now want run damage
control by getting society to basically toss my life in a ditch, I
would greatly prefer over being stuck in a mental institution like
some unfortunately suppressed delusional Nietzsche.

### [Wherefore The Rollerrink Drama Went Thermonuclear](#wherefore-the-rollerrink-drama-went-thermonuclear)

#### Step One: Label Someone With Mental Illness, Particularly Paranoia

#### Step Two: Obsequiously Encourage Others to Virally Label The Target As Paranoid

#### Step Three: Profit! That Person Can NEVER Question Your Motives Or The Motives Of Anyone In Life Because That Critical Behavior Is Forbidden To People Labelled Schizo or Paranoid.

Their life will be *ruined*. They'll never be able to ascertain the
epistemic beliefs and information about others -- out of fear of
strengthening this label of mental illness. Making decisions about the
beliefs and thoughts of others -- the epistemic information-structures
in people's minds -- is critical to functioning as a person and
maturing as an adult. Unless the target has already developed
emotionally, they will likely blind themselves to all of the
information needed to develop healthy, mature adult behaviors. This is
all precisely how I responded after [Michael
Lehrke](https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/10004266/RC_Sports,_Inc_v_Lehrke)
labeled me as paranoid *in a geographically significant way in 2004*.

> (It's ok. I forgive you.... )


What Michael did to me then would have seemed insignificant to anyone
and it's certainly not anything I'm losing sleep over in 2018 ... but
that's what happened. He's not the only one who sought to label me
this way: simply the first and no single person can exert that much
influence on your life. A single person cannot exert that much
influence. However, the truth is that people like Michael Lerkhe, who
irresponsibly worshipped the book 48 Laws of Power, have a long
history of people they've deceived and manipulated. The trick is
gaining enough influence in a social environment where you monopolize
your position as a gatekeeper to success. Everyone will quickly forget
everything you did to them and your enemies because you're the primary
power broker: you can empower anyone you want *and fulfill the dreams
of any up-and-coming jamskater. One little gotcha about power: IF YOU
USE IT, DON'T LOSE IT.

> Sorry, Mike, I still don't believe you were actually that stupid.


My entire strategy in life since 2010 has been to abstract and
generalize the process I applied to combinatorially enumerate all the
jamskating moves, so I could apply it to something that matters:
bioinformatics, neurology, physics, philosophy, etc -- preferably
something that would give me money or power, so I could prove myself
in a domain, where my accomplishments couldn't be overwritten with
petty drama and where the people from my past could not affect
me. Once I achieved that understanding of the human creative process
and applied it to something -- perhaps earning a Nobel Prize along the
way -- then people would look back at jamskating and realize what had
happened to me for what it was.

### [Because You Methodically Tormented An Altruistic Person Who Loves Humanity](#because-you-methodically-tormented-an-altruistic-person-who-loves-humanity)

I eventually gave up on startups and began writing. I never got a more
amusing reaction from all the people who try to control me in my life
-- **I've been addicted to that ever since**. I don't give a fuck
about your money, your fame, or any of your petty measures of
success. None of that matters to me because it's apparently
*verbotten* to let me have any success whatsoever.

For me, life is a rigged game and I'm laughing because, to me, people
are the game; *humanity is the game*. If I ever achieve moderate
success, it's because I've so sufficiently dominated all of you. It's
because I've done something so great that all your petty eichmanns
have to go back through my life and account for everything they did to
me along the way. At this point, I'd practically have to cure cancer:
this accomplishment must be so great, it outweighs all the falsehoods
and defamation.

I do not care about what humanity has to say about me because they'd
never say anything that reflects the truth of my identity anyways:
*IT'S A RIGGED GAME.* Instead, what people say and think is only
useful to me insofar as it indicates whether or not I've become great
enough to unbind.


This is hardly a strategy I recommend, but it's just about all I've
got: how's it working out for you? What did humanity do to raw,
unpotentiated greatness? You destroyed it because you fear what you do
not understand. And when I achieve such a great accomplishment --
whether it's possible to surpass your petty, judgemental bullshit or
hopeless and impossible -- it will be so great, but also good *BECAUSE
YOU METHODICALLY TORMENTED AN* **ALTRUISTIC** *PERSON WHO LOVES
HUMANITY*. And you'll never do it to someone like me again.
