- note that this is an analysis of the final(?) fight scene in Enter
  the Dragon, but that only the titles of each section should be
  considered to be relevent. much of the other analysis is derivative
  from the titles themselves as each section relates to conflict and
  war, instead of being an analysis of the scene.

# Fighting with shadows

#### your enemy will be ruthless & destroy you immediately

- if your enemy is to be mortally feared, they will strike
  immediately, but this is an enemy simple and easy to handle.
  - here, i imply "mortally" not in the fatal sense, but in the sense
    that they will immediately go for their objectives and all your
    advantages, without hesitation.

  - however, what does not kill you makes you stronger. what attacks
    you, but does not end up hurting you is mere energy begging to be
    siphoned.
  - as long as you survive -- or as long as your objectives and
    critical assets are unharmed -- then if you are fluid, you can
    swiftly turn any remorselessly sociopathic attack into a weapon
    against your enemies.
    - natural law is real. the institutions of man exist simply as a
      facade built on top of natural law
      - (briefly define natural law to make my intent clear).
      - when these legal institutions function well or are not subject
        to corruption, they should simply
    - the golden rule: i intend what is best for all people and i seek
      to find what they intend as best for themselves and those around
      them and then i act to honor what is best for them and best for
      myself because we are all one. The golden rule sums up the
      sentiment that we are all one. Do not do something unto another
      that you would not have them do unto you. This is also very
      close to Plato's definition of justice
      - when you follow this rule, (natural law treats you well.) when
        the institutions of men violate this law and use legal force
        without justification, then natural law turns against them.

#### learn to dance with them, you're going to need it.

- if your enemy is to be truly feared, they will not strike
  immediately. the more sophisticated enemy knows that your energy is
  to be used. therefore, they will dance with you as you fight. There
  will be give and take, but you must know their intentions and follow
  their focus at all times.
  - truly, whether you are battling against an enemy or alongside a
    friend, to function most effectively, you must know their
    intentions and know them and follow their focus.

#### wear your scars proudly.

- Commit yourself to no actions for which the consequences cannot be
  proudly worn.

- they will try to shame you with both their values systems, your own
  and all the miscontortions of both.

- they will have a weapon that they will never let go of. it's not a
  fair fight. it never was. do not allow your space to become choked
  out: you need air, water, fire. you need people. you need food.

- when that one doesn't work, they have plenty more you've never
  seen. enjoy each and every one you get the chance to see because
  each one is special. some are never meant to be seen ... for long.

  - story of the house from "The Ancient Magus Bride"
  - some people never leave. you get to take one thing home with you.
    i took them all and made new ones.
  - the longer that you withstand baptism by fire without dying, the
    more of these you bring home with you.

#### make them grab the weapon they didn't intend to use. your weapon is the way itself.

- notice how the water wheel in this scene has eight spokes. this
  scene is full of symbolism.

#### bait them into breaking their precious things

- like their stilted precious lies they've worked so hard to protect,
  maintain and perpetuate. they will defend these to the end -- if
  they intend to. but they may allow themselves to be mistaken into a
  conflict where they plan on getting you to attack these things,
  instead being drawn into a conflict over the very validity of these
  things.


#### grab their eyes with your fearless gaze & never let go

- the body always follows the head, but more critically: the body
  always follows the projection of focus.
  - this is especially true of people acting in time-sensitive
    situations. they need to know what the consequences of their
    actions will be. in martial arts, this means being aware of your
    opponent's body position, where they have placed their body's
    weight and where they are going to shift their weight.
    - we can subconsciously understand the paths available for an
      opponent to shift their weight. there are infinitely many ways
      they could move, but these paths form probability
      distributions. in other words some moves are more likely and in
      some body positions, your opponent is more likely to move in
      specific ways.
  - you can only know this and activate those subconscious circuits by
    looking where you are going. so in martial arts, it is critical
    that you look at the opponent, you never look down and you always
    follow their eyes.

- this idea of shifting focus also applies at a higher level. when
  your adversaries are groups of people with hierarchical structures,
  they have to pass information to each other.
  - they may seek to confuse you and they will especially do this if
    they are sophisticated enough. the degree to which they excel at
    this is the degree to which you should be on guard. so once you
    catch someone in lie after lie after lie, you better be paying
    attention.
  - much in the same way to martial arts, these people are keeping
    their eye on pieces of information, especially time-sensitive
    information that may totally change.
    - so, when they pass information around the hierarchy, their
      superiors can only be sure that the information is known for as
      long as it can be guaranteed to not change.
    - this means that the people lower down in the hierarchy must
      constantly assess awareness of the critical pieces of
      information and pass it or the important changes around the
      hierarchy.
      - this is very similar to the [Byzantine
        Generals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance#Byzantine_Generals'_Problem)
        problem, which is about information consensus in networked
        computer servers.

- the point is, even if you are being attacked from many angles, if
  you pay attention to what pieces of information people are
  retrieving, you can know when they are going to strike.
  - the degree to which they deconstruct their information-acquisition
    tactics is the degree to which their actions are correlated, even
    if they are lying about being connected with one another.
  - in cybersecurity, where all the adversaries can totally obfuscate
    their actions to assess your computer systems for vulnerabilities,
    the above forms the basis of an assets-first approach:
    - simply know what is valuable to you or your opponent and watch
      for anyone to be concerned about it. these could be people or
      groups in a war. these could be bots and hackers.
    - when anyone approaches what is valuable to you, pay attention to
      who they are, where they came from and where they're going.
      - it's probably nothing, but when you're being assaulted in
        cyberspace, these state-actors, non-state-actors and bots are
        going to probe you for vulnerabilities from all angles.
      - it's impossible to know who's going to approach you, but it is
        very possble to know what they're going to approach.
      - this is no different than Overwatch, where the game's almost
        up and you've got the point. the enemy has no choice but to
        throw a last ditch effort to seize the point. where do you
        place your forces? on the limited number of paths to the
        point, if you control it. you already know where they're going
        to go if they're going to win the game.

#### when they are certain you'll strike, feint instead

- henry david thorough comment
  - the path of least resistence is useful, but it is not always the
    correct path
  - the most fluid person will have no certainty to their intention.
    - "Mara is blinded to their actons"
    - by fluid, i mean, they don't necessarily need or want anything
      and thus cannot be predicted to react an any way.
    - therefore an adversary facing them cannot know what any of the
      fluid man's paths of least resistence might be => because evil
      knows you by knowing your desires, by learning your reactions
      and by predicting your next moves.
      - but if you could want anything at the next moment and only
        truly want what is best for all people, regardless of its cost
        to you personally, Mara is quite literally blinded to
        you. Evil cannot comprehend a man like that.

- if your battle is just, then your enemy will expect you to strike
  given an opening. whether you choose to strike or to feignt, always
  keep the moral high ground. There is always another way.
  - by the way, i'm a pretty horrible person myself, but i try to live
    by these rules. i'm tired of fighting, but i don't want to lose
    because of what it means for everyone who has helped me and
    everyone who will suffer if the type of person i am is dejected by
    society.

#### be ready to fight with shadows

- these are all the neutral people who have been poisoned against
  you. it is critical to remember that *they are not your enemy*.
  - you must become formless when you fight your true enemy.
- if you do not or cannot develop a "sixth sense" at this point, you
  should just give up.

#### once you will start fighting with shadows you will become weary fast

- you maintain this burn rate for sociophysical energy. every
  interaction you encounter will be seen as neutral by the other
  people, while they have heard much about you. be wary, you're under
  a microscope and anything you do will be used against you.
  - instead, display such radiant truth that those who are set against
    you cannot possibly continue to assail you.
  - in this way, they will become demoralized first, then will begin
    to question those who set them upon you. finally, they will
    realize the truth all along.

- however, if you are sociophysically isolated before this happens,
  you may wake up to realize you have nothing. there are several
  dangers here, but the truth is that nothing may become the greatest
  asset you have for carrying forward on the path you that should
  truly be on, which is your own path and the path of truth. both must
  be one and the same if you are to hope for success.
  - if you can resist falling for the first things your enemy offers
    you as appeasement, then you will find that having nothing offers
    your enemy nothing to take away. they have nothing to threaten and
    nothing to harm. you have nothing to lose. no one can claim you
    are predicating your decisions on what you have because you have
    nothing -- except the truth and what you stand for.
    - do not accept gifts from the source of your problems, if you do
      not validate them first. they may simply be trojan horses, at
      best.

- reference Mordecai protesting by wearing a sackcloth

#### when they pull you into the hall of mirrors, you're fighting shadows
  of yourself that do not exist

- if they invite you to battle in the hall of mirrors, it is for
  show. they seek to desecrate your image and your story, using you as
  the moral to their story.
  - instead, you must destroy their images and your reflections
    too. destroy all of the image that cannot be used to serve your
    interests or feed your energy. it is the only way to win
  - let the only thing to remain be your own authenticity.

- when you cannot lose, slay them by pushing them into their own
  weapon: *THE ONE THEY NEVER INTENDED TO EXIST*

- know your enemy. know yourself
  - your enemy will see to throw you off guard by (pushing your
    buttons)

- in your victory, do not become your enemy, in who they were or are
  or in who you were or have become

- path of least resistance?
