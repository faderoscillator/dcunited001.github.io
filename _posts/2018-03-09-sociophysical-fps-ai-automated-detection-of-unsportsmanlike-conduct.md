- throwing people's games as a protest tactic (omg he's online, let's
  make him lose. we're really good at losing. like really good
  losers. we don't really know how to win, but we sure do know how to
  lose as a tactic and distribute the losses across our ranks.
  "strength" in numbers. typical communist shenenigans.)


Most people don't understand what is possible with algorithms because
the math required is astronomic. To most people, math is boring, but
to those people who don't find it fascinating, I say "You need to
learn a little more math." The problem is that the math you learn in
high school **is** boring. You're never going to use it. The math you
learn in undergrad: also boring and mostly useless, except perhaps
statistics.

However, graduate and post-graduate maths are so incredibly
useful. But the secret is that everyone uses these maths, even though
they have no idea what they are. High school football stars use
stochastic calculus, every time they pass the ball. Every person with
emotional intelligence has to intuitively navigate set theory,
typology, category theory, etc. Yes, I'm saying the average person who
is successful with spurring a group into engaging conversation
understands homomorphisms -- and probably better than the math geek.

However, if you want to truly excel, you need to model social
activities using math. To most, this is incomprehensible: how can
socialization be mathematic. *BUT IT IS* and the best part? This
notion remains enigmatic to almost everyone. They can't know how you
know. To manipulative people or people who seek to control you, this
is infuriating! Toxic people and neutral people possessed by toxic
information will get caught in their shenanigans over and over.

#### &#9312; Not only would they not understand how you know

#### &#9313; Nor would they care to have you explain to them

#### &#9314; But *they couldn't possibly understand if you tried.*

Not that they could never understand; they just do not have the
prerequisites and have been brainwashed to avoid learning what is
necessary: advanced mathematics. Throughout history, this stuff was
taught to the layman, initiates and neophytes through metaphor -- no
math necessary, at least not as maths are known and written down in
the modern era.

However, if you can't explain something in 200 words or less, using
only words from a list of the 1,000 most common basic word roots in a
language -- the average person is NOT ever going to listen to you. It
doesn't matter how effective your models of some phenomenon are. And
the manipulative, toxic people in your life? They're definitely not
going to listen. Good luck making it to 50 words without them using a
higher-order conversational trick to prod you away from **the point**.

If you're judging how frequently someone uses such social or
conversational tactics, you're applying statistics to psychosocial
mechanics. However, it's not exactly beneficial to call people out on
their shit all the time. Their shit stinks; they know it; they're not
going to own up to it.

### [Bad News: There's No "Good Guy Greg" Algorithm](#bad-news-theres-no-good-guy-greg-algorithm)

This, of course, segues brilliantly into the FPS genre and,
particularly, automated algorithms for detecting unsportsmanlike
conduct in online video games. This is fantastic because it means that
Santa Clause's job of keeping track of who's naughty and who's nice
just got a whole lot easier. Just don't tell the elves they're getting
laid off quite yet. At least wait until springtime.

Yes, If you're wondering: I'm saying "What if there *was* an Asshole
Algorithm?" Good news! *There is an Asshole Algorithm.* The bad news?
The genuinely-good-person algorithm is much harder and probably
computationally intractible.

You're probably familiar with the Asshole Algorithm. At least, those
women in your life are. It boils down to: who is a good listener?
Depending on the application -- whether its an FPS algorithm or a
sociophysical algorithm -- for computers, it all comes down to which
[entities and agents] are good at both sending and receiving input and
output. How do you measure "good" here? You can't, but you damn sure
can measure "bad" which is what I mean when I say that there's an
Asshole Algorithm, but no Good Guy Greg Algorithm.

#### Sorry, Greg. You're Not on the Nice List, But You Damn Sure Aren't On The Naughty List

Compassion is a hard problem and there are many ways to do it way, but
only a few ways to do it wrong. Don't look at me as an example. I'm a
horrible example, but I hardly have social and financial resources to
do *anything* for *anyone else*, EVER. Therefore, I'm always tightly
chained down, with no way to *give anything to anyone, ever.* That
makes it easy to presume that no one will be there to give me
anything, after enough of this abuse.

# [Automated Detection of Unsportsmanlike Conduct in Sports](#automated-detection-of-unsportsmanlike-conduct-in-sports)

- many of these are generic and would work with any FPS. most of these
  I've been imagining while playing overwatch.
  - that's what I do when i'm doing anything: focusing on tuning my
    cognition by making my metacognition universal
  - so, when i'm playing Overwatch -- and i'm not getting tanked by
    Nietzsche's herd-mentality slaves who abuse toxic passive
    aggressive tactics throw the game to subversively stick political
    adversaries in Bronze -- i'm thinking about FPS algorithms, FPS
    from a sociophysical perspective, communication, signaling, team
    cooperation and how to be an effective leader.
    - despite the aforementioned vile political subversives, i have
      found my answer for you and all the lilliputian scum like you:
      algorithmic analysis of your passive aggressive bullshit that
      you cannot possibly understand. therefore, how could you
      possibly avoid detection by these algorithms?
    - that said, these people have been rare in this competitive
      season in Overwatch. Once you get stuck in bronze, you can't get
      out. It's impossible unless you find a good cadre of friends to
      play with because people in Bronze use Bronze-level tactics, so
      not only are your teammates weaker and less likely to care about
      owning a microphone, being stuck here constricts the variety of
      experience you are exposed to.

- ever want to know a list of ALL the games thrown in MLB/NFL history?
  - actually, this would be a hard problem because there's so many
    eyes on a single game and pro player who's throwing knows the game
    well enough.
    - the financial incentive can enable them to be tactical about
      throwing the game while showing their true colors with a minimal
      amount of time investment or divestment
    - the greater the number of team mates, the more people that must
      cooperate to throw the game at a critical moment.
      - so, this is way easier in overwatch, especially in matches
        with minimal time investment

### Bad Players are an Opportunity to Learn To Teach

- it's OK if you're not great at Overwatch. I'm not good either. Not
  yet. However, someone who wants to improve and cooperate is
  1,000,000 times more pleasant to play with. Even if they're not
  great or even if they are terrible performers, if tey listen and
  chat, I can usually work with them to improve team performance.

### Bad Teammates Are Worse Than Dead Weight

- What I cannot stand is the type of toxic individual that decides to
  spew their passive aggressive goo all over you and your team without
  ever intending to give you notice. However, your days are numbered
  because it is very possible to architect tractible algorithms that
  pick you out and point you out for who you really are -- not a bad
  player, but a bad teammate. Bad players can be great teammates,
  actually.

- In the last season, OW Season 7, as many as 1 in 20 players made me
  suspect they were passive aggressive. At that time, I couldn't be
  confident who was throwing and who was playing. This would be
  strange -- why would you throw and why would people throw my games,
  if apparent strangers couldn't possibly recognize my online moniker
  - this can be partially explained by "smurfing" and "boosting"
    players, who may be socially or financially incentivized to boost
    the ranking of shitty players.
    - unfortunately, this ruins games for people and ruins the play
      experience, which is why i'd like to pitch some of these
      algorithm ideas to blizzard.
      - i'm sorry, that shit is so toxic.
      - if you have boosted members matched on your team, it means
        they are heavy weight, albeit not dead weight.
      - even worse, in order to boost lower ranking players, the
        "smurfed" accounts must lose some games to keep their ranking
        low.
- it is likely that this malincentivization without algorithmic
  recognition is entirely the cause of matching and ranking problems
  - it ruins competitive mode, unless you lose a few games until you
    find a team who doesn't lose and stick with them or unless you
    form a cadre of players who always plays together.
    - if you're socially isolated, this can be a bit difficult.

<iframe width="560" height="315"

  - I now can easily tell who is cooperative and who is engaged in
    passive aggressive tactics. OW Season 8, i can easily determine
    with 99% certainty that 1 in 100 players are non-cooperative
    douchebags -- from the minimal data signals in the OW HUD
    interface alone.

- This post will describe many algorithms for pinpointing these
  players. There are enough tractibly constructed signals that a
  combination of these can be combined for algorithms that excel in
  determining players who throw the game. GTFOH with that shit. If you
  want to play around, at least get off competitive. Thanks for
  expanding my mind. I now understand automated methods for
  identifying you in FPS, which serves as a fantastic example of how i
  can design similar methods for identifying people like you in my
  career and in my life.

<a name="throwing-players-typically-throw-for-the-remainder-of-the-game" />

### [Throwing Players Typically Throw For The Remainder of the Game](#throwing-players-typically-throw-for-the-remainder-of-the-game)

- who starts passive-aggressively throwing a game only to reverse that
  decision in less than 15 minutes?
  - this actually results in a long-trending time series signature
    where analysis via window functions can produce the recognition of
    recognize probabilistic state change.
    - that is, if you can recognize where a player started throwing
      the game from a set of a few dependable, computationally
      tractible signals, you can be validate that assumption by
      testing it against the assumption that most passive aggressive
      people are going to continue being passive aggressive.

If you can't love the people closest to you -- not just "tolerate" or
use them, *actually* love them -- then how can you keep people
together? If you can't love the people furthest from you, or you don't
want to, then how have you developed the empathy to understand how
they think? And thus, how can you expect to actually bring them
together. If this is you, then you seek to dominate or destroy, not to
bring people together. Someone who does that, loves the people who are
furthest from them and develops empathy to understand the way they
think.

This isn't to say that you should help them do what you disagree with
or cannot tolerate. Developing an understanding for how others think
-- especially those who you have determined to be "wrong" is a
pragmatic and expedient means of bringing people together. There is no
other way. If you want to be strong, you will find others who think,
believe and see differently and you will make yourself stronger by
adapting their perspectives, instead of disconnecting or dominating
them. Most of all, you will listen and, though you might not let
yourself be persuaded, you will certainly be stronger when reasoning
with people like them. All people are the same and all people are
unique.

<a name="why-is-passive-aggressive-behavior-appealing" />

### [Why Is Passive Aggressive Behavior Appealing?](#why-is-passive-aggressive-behavior-appealing)

- this brings us to a fantastic question: why is passive aggressive
  behavior appealing? it's because it confers advantage towards the
  attainment of a goal, especially if that goal is supported by people
  who feel traditionally disenfranchised. sometimes passive aggressive
  tactics are appropriate, but I don't believe that passive aggressive
  behavior patterns ever are.
  - the problem comes where groups of people find themselves
    consciously or unconsciously motivated by smaller groups of
    subversive people, who encourage people to leverage passive
    aggressive tactics coupled with a shutdown of communication,
    completely passively.
    - this communication shutdown prevents people from talking,
      exacerbates problems that cooperation is intended to solve. if
      people don't communicate by default, how can they cooperate?
    - we need the opposite: homogenization and heterogenonization of
      balanced communications from the small groups all the way up
      through large groups. in society with networking and social
      media, you can measure the well-connectedness of groups. there
      are automated means of identifying vulnerable, used and hurt
      people. manipulative people seek to keep their prey in a
      vulnerable state. these are detectable signatures, but what does
      the NSA do with its capabilities? *IT ENABLES ROGUE AGENTS OF
      THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE!!!* ... at
      least, occasionally. We can do better.



### Competing Game Publishers Can Leverage Toxicity to Encourage Players to Jump Ship

- publishers with a new IP can encourage/exaggerate toxic behavior on
  other platforms, though this isn't exactly a wonderful tactic to be
  caught engaging in.
  - there is aggregate toxicity in networks. online networks for new
    games and new IP's are typically full of optimism, not
    toxicity. this aggregate toxicity changes over time and people
    naturally gravitate from one platform to another, consciously and
    unconsciously.
  - by spinning game experiences and, particularly, spinning
    information that sets the frame of how people consider their
    experiences in games determines how they will make decisions about
    where to invest their time & energy. this isn't new. it's classic
    marketing.
    - e.g. calling Overwatch a "MOBA" FPS was almost certainly
      something that was started by rival publishers -- who most
      likely developed traditional tower-defense-style MOBA's that
      they felt were threatened by Overwatch.
      - this is a perfect example of the kind of frame-poisoning that
        follows me around life, wherever I go. the only thing that
        would ever save me from this, absent completely standing up to
        it and defeating it, is a total and complete change of
        identity with no looking back.
      - "if it's happening to you everwhere you go, it's not them,
        it's YOU" => this quote is like an tragic onion of innuendos.
        - depending on the actual intended meaning, the person who
          says this to you probably means well, but i'm not sure that
          they ever actually understand what this means for someone
          who's battling complete and total defamation.


# Metrics And Signals for Overwatch

- all of these metrics are essentially signals

### Damage/Heals

- total damage given/received, heals given/received
- heal-specific metrics?
  - potential nearby heals that go unhealed.
    - need to look at the total team's (maxHP - HP) tapered by
      distance to player, so the players who need healing but are far
      away don't count.
    - this metric is a pretty simple O(1) arithmetic calculation if
      the player distances are already prepared (and they are
      necessary for other metrics)
    - this is a really good metric for Mercy players, but not Ana
      players ... Ana is hard (not enough experience)

### efficient utilization of controls

  - advanced players always have a better grasp of the controls.
    - e.g. on PS4 Overwatch, i can use four fingers on left & right to
      control all features of mercy with zero inhibition or increase in
      perceived complexity
      - on PC, this is nothing, since you have a Keyboard and full
        range of complexity

### efficient utilization of cooldown

  - advanced players will always exhibited a distribution of ability
    inter-activation times **with a lower bound** than average players
    - this usually means they're engaging the enemy more often
    - novice players will not activate their abilities as frequently

### distance from objective

  - time to attain objective
  - turnover of objective area
  - player/team DPS when holding objective area

### distance from team members

- distance from each team member
  - teams that are closer can respond to each other more quickly
  - also, somehow configure this L2-norm to work with some form of a
    norm generated by the simplicial complex of your team members
    - as well as enemies and all players
    - in this case, the "distance" metric for the L2-norm becomes
      something that measures the area/volume of the polygon

### situational awareness

- measure "intentionality" of FoV movement & correction
  - so, players who can aim the best will need to correct
    minimally. when the adversary starts to evade, this is hard to
    measure.
    - this is a good measure for identifying aim hacks: the player
      just aims too good, with a direct FoV ∂θ path
      - the ∂θ angle should be parameterized with ∂q => this accounts
        for an aim hack that moves player-FoV while accounting player
        change in position
        - to calculate the "directness" of **angular change with
          respect to the player position** this requires a model with
          Lie Algebra

  - at a high-level, this hard to measure, but a simple metric is a
    measure of Field of View volume/spread over time. (FoV =~ camera
    frustum)
    - there are several ways to get a measure of FoV spread/volume
      - calculate volume of FoV, but contrast the FoV frustum for each
        frame and taper the previous frustum's volume.
        - i hope this can be done w/o voxels. i'm almost certain it
          can be.
      - integrate over the ray-trace from player's FoV frustum without
        bouncing the rays (each rays volume counts as a cone, until it
        hits a surface)
        - this can easily be done with the GPU, but is something that
          needs to be computed to a 1D scalar time-series that's
          pushed up to the master server
    - the above doesn't really connect the FoV measure to any
      meaningful re-orientation of the player's view. so if the player
      moves their viewpoint around very quickly, they get a higher
      score on this metric.
      - but advanced players look fast and know when to look
      - novice players will do this much less and poorly
      - it's simply one more feature for ML or statistical models. its
        correlation adds value in conjunction with many other features
  - the same FoV metric, calculated for the team, without counting
    overlap.

### For any scalar values:

- 1D time series
  - ∂-damage & ∂-heals

- metrics regrouped and parameterized by a powerset of team members
  - if these metrics are themselves time-series, this becomes
    expensive, especially for GPU-calculations like FoV volume/spread
    - the GPU does the calculations and pipes the result stream either
      to the Gamestate server (...not) or directly to the Stats server
    - but at somepoint to multiplex the player-specific 1D timeseries
      to a powerset-parameterized (2^p)-D timeseries, which itself
      requires way too much compute to be useful.
      - but not if each 1D FFT spectrum is a set of features, which
        are direct-summed (instead of tensor-product)

- these metrics expand into data that is expensive:
  - (1) to store
  - (2) even moreso to push from Server to Clients
  - thus, some of these metrics, if they are computable/scalable/etc
    should produce streams that are immediately pushed to a Stats
    container from the Gamestate server
    - from the Stats container, they should be tabulated in
      process-bound stream processing or sent to a set of stream
      processing containers for that game.
    - because some of these options aren't so scalable, then

### Misc Metrics

- damage response time
- accuracy (X) distance
  - useful for players with small spread of fire (tracer, soldier,
    hanzo, widow, etc)
- high engagement immediately before loss, when players hang onto
  their alts indicates a thrown game/round


# Higher-Order Signals Analysis

### Signals Analysis to Identify Aim Hacks

- this already exists AFAIK. it's easy to beat, depending on what you
  use to detect it. aim hacks will always modify control motions in
  ways that are appear to be a confusing, merged stream of combined
  mouse input sources where the (dx/dy) of each source is
  characteristically different with each update cycle
  - that is, the player's mouse will always move fairly smoothly
    whereas the aim hacks input modification will not necessarily be
    smooth
  - the combination of both mouse & aim hack will certainly NOT be
    smooth and there will be two distinct jittery streams of combined
    input, where the continuity characteristics of the single
    combined, observed stream are minimal.
    - since the stream is always cycling discrete updates, any notion
      of "continuity" between differentiation/integration is arbitrary
      - therefore, the methods of continuity analysis must account for
        this, but it's very difficult to combine two streams without
        producing artifacts, though they may be difficult to detect
        with a discretized input signal
        - is this true for merged user input streams or for
          artificially modified streams generally?
    - if there is the presence of discontinuous noise in the mouse
      movement (i.e. lots of jitter from one of the dual input sources
      to cancel out the difference between the player's mouse and the
      aim hack's input)
  - another way to defeat aim hacks is to encourage the inclusion of
    accelerometers in the player's mouses. this augments the analysis
    of continuity and consistency
  - the metric above (with Lie Algebra, ∂θ & ∂q) can be used to
    augment aim hack detection with another inputstream independent of
    the input method.

#### autodetect map hacks

- ... hmmm.. it's hard to detect a high rate of "lucky" guesses
  because the window of time is so large
  - it really depends on whether the hack depends on data via network
    & requests

#### reverse map "hack" (to circumvent lack of API?)

  - what was this idea? it wasn't a hack to cheat ... but may appear
    to be, from the perspective of Overwatch if it required signalling
    many requests for game-state data to the server
    - i think generally, online FPS games prefer to use server
      architectures which are Pub/Sub where the battle.net server
      publishes game-state changes to players
      - ideally, the players can only send UI data
      - however, in practice, with (> 20ms) or especially (> 50ms)
        ping times, there are significant requirements for consensus
  - it was for personal metrics, i think? and for metrics on team
    performance. maybe there's an api with a hook to establish a HTTP
    stream for consistent metrics
    - if not, you can probably get the data, but its requests &
      interaction might resemble a maphack

### Signals Analysis on Density of Individual Team Damage Projection (Potential/Actual)

- overwatch teams that stay together on the map win. it's something
  that always *ALWAYS* distinguishes experienced players. so if I
  played an overwatch game with 6 bronze players, a few of whom were
  smurfs with gold accounts, I KNOW IT IMMEDIATELY.
  - like peewee soccer players bunching up for all the glory, bronze
    players don't know how to position themselves and dont know TO
    position themselves.
    - further, you HAVE TO signal via VOICE to consistenly coordinate
      positioning and esp to longer timescales. if you're team isn't
      on mic, you might as well sign out of that competitive mode, bc
      you ain't going anywhere.
  - those gold smurfs will group up and almost form a PHALANX. they
    project damage onto the DPS field and heals onto the HPS field in
    higher densities, moving as a group.
    - a team that's spread out that encounters a phalanx of 4 to 6,
      the density of damage is so high, they get ripped up and picked
      off immediately.
    - the phalanx team has a major spatial advantage against
      individual players. they stand no chance.
    - the bunched up phalanx-like positioning is great for mercy bc
      she can dart from player to player. if she stays fast, it's real
      hard to hit her, without getting drawn into high density damage.
      - tight formations are also great for stacking character's
        standard AoE abilities. the close & bright chaotic particle
        effects even restrict ability to visually discern/identify
        which abilities/attacks the enemies are using

- how to measure this individually and as a team? the console needs to
  render low-res 2D/3D texture that captures DPS from friends and
  foes.
  - you can calc this for each individual player on their console,
  - then simply ADD in the Stats container as the stream is
    received. the texture should be low-res. or it could be a more
    aggregate value. or it could be a 2D/3D texture that's purely
    relative to the character position ... maybe (if so, then you also
    send q.x, q.y, q.z for each char) ... hmmm
  - the data sent over the stream should be a differential texture,
    similar to a video codec.
  - it's not enough to add the textures together, but to also have a
    metric that really focuses on layered damage. (e.g. multiply
    damage points occupying the same space ... although that's a
    primitive example)

- the reconstructed 2D/3D team/all damage fields are useful for
  the *cheap* gradient-based algorithms for detecting engagement,
  described below.
  - it's expensive to generate/transmit this texture, but cheap to run
    the gradient-based algorithms

### Signals Analysis to Quantify Player Engagement

- the idea here is to determine whether a player is getting in the
  action. imagine football players who are supposed to block, but
  don't approach the enemy fast enough. or soccer players who bunch
  themselves together.
  - so there should be ways of measuring how the players use the space
    of the map. some of these are simple and others are more
    difficult. whether they're computable/scalable in a big data
    setting is another question.
  - in soccer (and basketball to some degree), players prefer to
    spread out for opportunities to pass efficiently, unless they are
    near the ball. in that case, they sociophysically are attracted to
    the ball and indirectly to each other, but they prioritize:
    - (1) ball control
    - (2) forward pressure
    - (3) controlling the dynamics of nearby player positions with
      their space of potential paths/options

- in overwatch and other FPS shooters (depending on the gameplay mode)
  you must engage the enemy, making gains while avoiding losses. you
  can avoid losses all you want, but it doesn't help with
  holding/gaining the point.
  - if you're on the point, you can guarantee the opponents will
    engage you. if you're attacking, you have to find yourself within
    attack range of the opponent. depending on your character, this
    implies various distances of engagement.
    - novice players take their time doing this and are more
      interested with other game mechanics than staying on the edge of
      combat.
      - they are still newbie, so they don't react to engagement well,
        but they don't know to seek it out either ... like a sophomore
        in a college bar trying to pull some girls.

- (from note, partially overlapping with the above): FPS signal
  analysis based on how players engage actual and potential
  DPS/Abilities fields projected onto the collective space of the map
  - in other words, there are team DPS/HPS & abilities fields, but
    these methods work primarily based analysing player position and
    movement in relation to the gradient/laplacian of those DPS/HPS
    fields
    - F(DPS) := DPS field for enemy team
    - trying to explain this without drawing pictures is difficult
      - but these factors are computable, if not on every game, at
        least scaleably computable in GPU-cloud-based stream
        processing architectures, where records indicating player
        positions are rendered to textures (have i already explained
        this)
    - metric of player/team engagement: `integral(time spent on DPS
      boundary) * F(DPS @ position) / max(DPS)`
      - the second factor above `F(DPS @ position) / max(DPS)` is a
        metric that is attempting to measure player engagement with
        the enemy damage field, while accounting for the player's
        skill in dodging the maximum values in that damage field.
        - this factor can be computed across various spatiotemporal
          scales (and, yes, the definition above needs a lot of work)

- ... describe method

### Signals Analysis To Detect Throwing Player Signatures

- detect players who are throwing the game (and other lame passive
  aggressive behaviors)
  - it's easy to detect idle players
- this can be done by recognizing signature patterns in UI datastreams
  for each player

### Signals Analysis To Detect Players Who Are Unreasonably Boosting Novices

- high variance in DPS and other "engagement" metrics
  - hopefully simple metrics.
  - they may slow down or even occasionally throw games to keep low
    rankings (if they did, that'd be very lame for the players who
    lose games, but really shouldn't happen that often)

- need to pair fps in-game player/team signals/metrics with metadata
  - e.g. identify multiple accounts with same IP address and/or
    PC/Console ID multiple accounts
    - a single player can't play more one simultaneous game

### SIMPLE Signals Analysis on voice chat to identify natural leaders

- short-term signals analysis on voice chat
  - requires no linguistic/semantic processing! simple!
  - simply correlate emotional content of chat to 1D time series of
    player/team (damage/heal/field of view) metrics in an attempt to
    identify young people with natural leadership skills

- normally, most compsci people would assume that this is
  computationally prohibitive, but it is only expensive if you perform
  linguistic/semantic analysis.
  - this is purely analysis correlating emotional inflection in voice
    chat streams with short-term changes in 1D timeseries signals,
    like player damage, player orientation, etc

- if used in the overwatch platform, such an algorithm *should be
  successful* towards the application of identifying natural
  leaders. why?
  - because of overwatch's simple construction in competitive play:
    the 6-person teams, the limited set of well designed maps,
    Blizzard's well-planned changes to metagame via patching

- combinatorially, 6-person teams have more-predictable group dynamics
  than larger groups. in 6-person groups, the group dynamics are
  well-demonstrated by studies. you will almost always have an quick,
  informal selection of leaders and followers.
  - a good leader is nothing without good followers, but groups that
    are expected to coordinate their actions towards the attainment of
    specific objectives quickly will informally select their
    leaders.
    - since all six players must share the same voice channel, the
      voice channel is primarily constrained by time. if two people
      are talking at the same time, the value derived from voice chat
      plummets
    - what happens is that one or two people will quickly position
      themselves as "dominant" on the voice channel.
      - these leaders establish themselves ad hoc per round and per
        match of Overwatch. They will be the ones calling the shots,
        for the most part
      - the good followers -- who are less "dominant" but still
        critical -- will "subscribe" to messages from the more dominant
        players.
        - that is, they will be listening to the informal leaders and
          relaying information to them; as needed, as it becomes
          relevant or as it is requested.
  - because time is such a sensitive resource constraint on both the
    gameplay and the voice channel, the followers will mostly "ACK"
    (acknowedge), refer to short "bursty" pattern language to describe
    - because the voice channel is time-contrained, encoding emotional
      content into your voice-chat messages allows you to harness
      inflection to layer your messages with 'linear' emotional
      dimensions instead of purely 'discrete' semantic signaling
      - this is why you can expect to identify valuable data about
        group dynamics and particularly leadership and "followership"
        by analyzing the purely emotional content of voice data to
        correlate it to 1D time-series (damage, heals, ability usage,
        player distance)
      - the time-constraints force players to layer emotional content
        into their voice statements to convey information faster.

  - if you want to identify IRL leaders by analyzing the data/voice
    streams from Overwatch, you're looking for the people who are
    vocal early on, who project signals that their team follows
    - they're constantly helping project relevant details to their
      team members to help the GROUP form coherent situational
      awareness in a rapidly changing environment.

### Complex linguisitic analysis of voice chat signals in Overwatch

- perhaps computationally prohibitive (requires stream processing
  augmented by cloud instances with DSP & probably GPU)
  - or at least the computational requirements of voice-chat augmented
    by semantic analysis would present financial constraints
  - although, some of this can be preprocessed on the consumer's
    hardware, especially if some latency is allowed in analytics, then
    forwarded to the cloud for further processing
- furthermore, semantic analysis of overwatch in single-langauge
  regions would be simplar than you'd think. why? because the
  time-constraints placed on the shared voice chat force players to
  use short "bursty" langauge.
  - given an online game with a well-developed community and
    well-understood metagame -- i.e. thre are enough players, enough
    competition and competition is robustly incentivized
    incentivization -- these factors lend themselves to players
    self-organizing to cooperatively construct pattern languages.
  - if competitive gameplay has time-sensitive constraints, these
    pattern languages are optimized not for semantic parity, but for
    minimization of bandwidth usage.
    - so, there are evolutionary dynamics that encourage players to
      autonomously select/repeat a set of vocabulary that is
      meaningful, but widely understood without much need to define
      what the slang means within the game.
  - what this means is that the dictionary required for semantic
    recognition is bound by size:
    - morphemes are usually short and almost exclusively monosyllabic
    - grammer is minimized,
    - emotional inflection is used to encode more information and
    - the zipfs distribution for language used in games
      predispositions the slang towards the first
      - if the slang is well-harmonized throughout the community, it
        perhaps takes precedence to function words
    - tokens and strings specific to the game, like character names,
      will receive higher precedence in the zipfs distribution
      - these are excellent markers for understanding how gameplay
        mechanics and dynamics differ in competitive play amongst
        players of various skill levels
      - for example, some tactics are typical in bronze gameplay and
        some characters dominate in bronze gameplay, presenting
        problems players must respond to by naming the character in
        their communications to displace the threat posed by that
        character
      - for datamining for metagame changes or datamining to
        understand play dynamics amongs players of varying skill
        level, how helpful such signals would be is a great question
        for data scientists and computational linguists.
  - also, the zipfs distribution is likely tighter among pro players,
    who must understand the lingo and jargon to communicate
    effectively.
    - viz. players of higher skill level are far more likely to be
      using voice chat and to communicate with a more restricted,
      higher-bandwidth set of vocabulary

- analyzing the morphological aspects of zipfs' distribution in
  gameplay can inform game designers about reactions to metagames
  changes.
  - so, when a new character is released on overwatch, there should be
    significant displacement in the zipfs distribution elements for
    character names

- the analysis of my own psychology is *bullshit*, particularly with
  regard to my professional experience in my career
  - i am very cooperative. i am always seeking to learn and seeking
    improvement. i am quickly willing to admit my flaws. i want to
    succeed and i want to help others succeed around me -- REGARDLESS
    OF THEIR GODDAMN POLITICAL AFFILLIATIONS.
  - in my career, i have been treated like shit to be thrown away,
    since it is assumed that i can be labelled as "crazy"
  - crazy people aren't good leaders, they can't analyze group
    dynamics very well and they don't understand people.
  - i cannot wait until psychology, psychiatry and neurology are
    augmented with sophisticated data science because the labels,
    stereotypes and diagnoses of people who supposedly have mental
    illness will be upended
    - there are so many signals that will identify and distinguish
      TRUE MENTAL ILLNESS from the fictitious and factitious disorders
      artificially created by psychological warfare tactics.
    - i cannot wait. what infuriates me is knowing what people (NSA,
      etc) are out there doing with surveillance and how they are
      systematically destroying the mental health of political
      dissidents.

# Algorithms to Detect Throwing Players

- these are all signals that need to be combined.
  - what cannot determined with confidence is a player who is
    certainly *not* throwing the game
  - what can be determined with confidence is a player who is
    *CERTAINLY THROWING THE GAME*.

### Spectral Analysis of Player's Character Choice

- Hanzo-main joke: "never trust a hanzo main"
  - ... i don't really get it

- spectral analysis of the player's character choice, particularly:
  - compared to their usual ordered preferences of characters:
    - this season, recently and total
    - previous seasons, recently and total
  - compared to the sequencing of other player's choices
    - i.e. does the throwing player wait to pick a character that
      sucks with the team's composition? probably a harmless signal,
      but not in diamond and platinum levels.
    - does the throwing player *change* characters in response to
      others choices in a way that complements the team composition?
      or in a way that harms team composition?
  - does the player swap cooperatively characters with another player?
    i.e. do they share?  how quickly do they choose to do this? this
    is a good signal in the opposite direction and one that's likely
    computable.
  - overall, this is a weak signal. you hardly need to pick a specific
    character to throw a game. it's not fair to judge people for
    playing the game the way they want to.
    - the play decisions in the game are much more important.

### Aberrant Voice Channel Configuration

- if two or more players start out in the same group, but leave to
  join team chat, this can be a harmless signal, but it is certainly
  not an optimal signal.


### Matching Algorithms for Throwing Players So They Can Go Throw Themselves





# Metagame and Balancing

### Metrics/Measures for Map Balancing

#### Static Maps representing the regions of maps theoretically navicable by each specific character

- autogenerated manifolds representing the navigable space for each
  character model
  - different characters can naturally navigate different 3D regions
    of the 3D space of the map
    - this may be different when including physics
    - for some overwatch characters
  - these would need to be procedurally-generated per map, per
    character. it's conceiveable that a player might be capable of
    accessing areas of a map via glitch. it's also conceivable that,
    for some characters, it is not theoretically possible or
    computationally feasible to generate such a map


#### Accumulated (via playtesting)

- there are probability distributions, per game, per character and per
  player that represent the probability that you'd find a player in a
  particular position of
- this differs significantly from the static, procedurally generated
  navicable space of the map for each character. that represents the
  potential areas of the map where a character could possibly be found
  - whereas, under some conditions, those navicable-space maps are
    imperfect or not auto-generatable, these probabilistically
    generated maps can always be generated fairly simply, assuming the
    right stats are collected in each game. however, there is a lot
    more data to process.

### positional probability distributions and tactics

- d-va is a fun character for me to play because i have total free
  reign over the map. d-va is the fastest character who can always
  access any area of the map and make any spatiotemporal transition
  from place to place
  - because of this, d-va is a difficult character to anticipate. the
    set of positions where you can find d-va on a map is more spread
    out.
    - similarly spread out is the probability distribution
      representing the range of next-positions you might find a d-va,
      given that you know that player's current position
    - these assumptions about d-va's position & next-movement
      probability distributions are pure extrapolations of her
      movement characteristics:
      - d-va can move fast
      - d-va can launch herself to nearly any height of the map
        - this makes map position-transitions available to d-va, which
          are unavailable to almost any other character, except pharah
          and mercy, if mercy has a movement assist
    - the extrapolations of d-va's movement characteristics benefit a
      tactical, dive-diva player by making her unpredictable and fast.
      - mathematically, a skilled d-va player is quantifyably less
        predictable

### Continuous "N-Grams" for probabilistic movement prediction

- analyzing/understanding the set of navigable paths for each
  character over some given time interval `t` is critical for
  understanding Overwatch tactics, especially predictive aiming.
  - given that you know that character's position now, if you are
    familiar with that player's movement characteristics, you can
    anticipate a range of 2D or 3D space to which that character can
    possibly move.
  - the mathematical methods for effective or optimized predictive
    aiming are fascinating, given the considerations are specific to
    the character choice AND player-character play style
    - these methods involve some serious stochastic calculus, but all
      of these aspects are conditioned into the human mind over time.
    - no one has to know stochastic calculus to both understand and
      use predictive aiming as a technique.

- in computational linguistics, `n-grams` are used to predict the next
  word, given a sequence of `n` previous words. This is the process
  your phone uses to predict the next word you'll use.

#### TODO: explain how this relates to the description of linguistic n-grams

![Table of N-Grams]()

- the continuous analogue of n-grams likely uses [discrete exterior
  calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_exterior_calculus)
  to render a discrete path prediction problem into incrementially
  "more continuous" space.
  - that is, the algorithm would divide the navicable 2D or 3D space
    of the map into a self-similar lattice. the lattice is subdivided
    into incrementally smaller space-units
  - the probability distribution starts off as one that is very
    discrete: it looks like a histogram
    - as the space is subdivided, this probability distribution is
      regenerated for the smaller spatial units.
    - furthermore, there is the possibility of recursively applied
      spectral techniques that help adjust the probability
      distribution of estimated player next-positions

- how to extend this into continuous spaces? to predict `q` at `tn =
  (n*dt)` where tn is time `t` at step `n`, `dt` is the time step size
  and `q` is the player position.
  - the discrete exterior calculus must be spatiotemporal and not just
    spatial, which really throws my mind for a loop.

- these path-prediction algorithms intersect with [Euclidean Path
  Integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation#Euclidean_path_integrals)
  - this is basically the anticipated, actual movement of quantum
    particles, based on a "summation" of potential paths.
    - however, it is not simply a direct-summation of potential paths
      which is an important distinction. otherwise it would simply be
      a superposition of potential paths.

### In Practice, these algorithms are far more complicated

- the concept of a frequency of next moves -- or a superposition of
  most probable next paths -- is oversimplified because it's
  computationally intractible for simply two players.
  - that's before you reach the complexity of 6v6 movement
    characteristics and well before you reach the combinatorial
    expansion that disaggreates each player's specific character
    choice.
  - analyitical methods based on the dynamics of the (potential &
    actual DPS/HPS/abilities) fields are much more useful and
    computationally tractible.



###

- these methods would benefit greatly from the application of the
  Ansatz quantum mechnics and QC structure. These structures are,
  unfortunately, the most efficient such computational structures for
  predicting the unpredictable when you don't *or can't* understand
  the underlying mechanics of the system.
  - but they do reach a maximum degree of efficiency, even if you can
    virtualize quantum simulations over many groupings of lower-qbit
    systems.
    - this begins to approach universal quantum computation, which by
      the way [IS A FUCKING ARTICLE ON
      WIKIPEDIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Turing_machine).
      so before you sick your clueless goddamn NSA spooks on me, do
      some fucking research. fuck your dumbass family-destroying
      "detention" bullshit.




### Proactice Techniques Like Cover Fire For Funneling Player Movements

- no matter how robust a passive path-prediction algorithm is, it is
  never as effective as more proactive techniques: these are general
  techniques that funnel player movement.
  - cover-fire is such a technique

### Spectral All The Things


### the fluid dynamics of FPS team movement

- the best analogy for understanding player movement in Overwatch and
  FPS is fluid movement. players move like a fluid under
  pressure. even when not visible, you can anticipate player movements
  by understanding how your line of fire coaxes enemy player positions
  as if the enemy team is a fluid responding to the pressure of
  potential damage.
  - when you leave an opening, you render the players more
    predictable, unless they are expert players analyzing your tactics
    at a higher-level. however, most expert players have personal
    rules the allow them to circumvent vulnerability and accrue
    advantage, generally. they do have intuition for specific
    situations, but this is less useful because it's expensive.
    - however, more general rules are far more effective for
      maintaining advantage, maintaining/gaining control over space,
      utilizing the advantages of the space, and avoiding ceding
      general vulnerabilities to the enemy.



### Machine learning to Identify players who are fun to play with

- even if the algorithms are not accurate enough to be used, the
  understanding that your cooperativeness (good vibes) impacts your
  MMR ranking would itself incentivize players to be more friendly and
  more cooperative (at least when considering the first-order effects)
  - that is, such an algorithm wouldn't even need to "function" per
    se. the gaming company only needs people to believe that their
    cooperative nature impacts the matching algorithm's decisions
- such an algorithm could potentially be augmented using EEG/neural
  connections, which is a technology that has many implications for
  gaming, beyond matching algorithms



### Methods for Staging/Balancing Metagame Updates

- planning how to keep the game interesting as minor/major patches
  come out, as well as major expansions


- this is stuff i've thought about for a long time
  - (i've always wondered how blizzard did it...)
  - then, i realized => blizzard must have realized that you're not
    chasing "perfect" but instead you're chasing the "perfect"
    imperfect
    - and using playtesting & game-designer intuition to anticipate
      your players' response in how they adapt their strategy/tactics
      - many players won't notice. some will notice immediately. there
        will be a lot of flux in gameplay style gradually, but at
        differing rates at various strata of skill levels
  - you have to be familiar with how your players will respond,
    tactically and emotionally.
    - you need to be able to identify/discuss the "unnamable" aspects
      of gameplay and strategy. if you can measure these aspects
      that's fantastic.
    - you need to state/quantify your expectations for how change
      metagame will occur, then observe the changes and reflect on
      expected/actual response

  - you need the ideal amount of change: not so much your players get
    jerked around & frustrated, but enough that there's always a
    challenge to adapt.
    - with enough regular players, it may be possible to use big data
      to measure this amount of change and maybe speculate on the
      ideal amount of change

- however, if your process is too automated, then you can't have
  mnemonic values for gameplay mechanics (character HP, ability
  recharge time/cost/ammo)
  - these values need to be easy to remember. time is always easy to
    change (refresh time) because in a player's head, it's a feeling,
    not a number. they may know the ability refresh time, but they
    aren't *counting* it, like they count shots with Zarya when
    lobbing grenades.
  - in other words, "mnemonic" values are easy to remember, they don't
    get changed to 87 then 35 then 50, etc. so, the players can expect
    to *count*. if they can't expect this, then many players won't use
    repeatable tactics based on values and value ratios.
  - it's a wierd phenomenon, like deciding on whether to charge $1.75
    for a coffee before or after taxes, but much more critical to your
    player's cognition during gameplay and the level of effort they
    need to invest to stay up to date.
    - because of the above, you have to
