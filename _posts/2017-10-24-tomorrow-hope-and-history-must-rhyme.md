Philoctetes and its interpretation is incredibly relevant in our
time. To me, Philoctetes represents dejected individuals of many
types, whose story and whose energy is inconvenient or difficult to
engage. There are so many people like this: those who need health
care, those who cannot live without social programs, those veterans
who cannot afford health care. Unless we engage these individuals,
gain their support and do so in the manner of Neoptolemy -- without
deception and empty promises -- we will never conquer what lies before
us in history. If we operate on the assumption that we can consign
figures tainted with the inconvenient truths of reality to islands,
but steal their support when we need it, we operate moving forward
with the assumption that it is OK to use figures, who must bear the
details of their life in solitude and in shame.

The lines below are from
[The Cure at Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure_at_Troy),
based on Philoctetus, a Greek play about Neoptolemy's journey to seek
the aid of a former hero, driven into reclusion. Neoptolemy is the son
of Achilles, a hero whose flesh was immortal everywhere but his heel
and whom the Greeks surely could have saved if they just cauterized
his wound. Philoctetus is an interesting foil of Archilles and, at the
play's opening, has barely managed to survive a wound festering for
ten long years.

The lines were quoted by Bill Clinton in 1995 and, most recently, in
[Joe Biden's recent lecture for the Brzezinsky Prize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciaUkiARvyw). For
Greece, the Trojan War was so unprecedented, Homer rendered it the
architypical war in Greek mythos.  The Odyssey was a loom upon which
the greatest of all Greece's legends would be woven -- or at least of
those moreso focused on the works of men than that of the gods. To me,
[Philoctetus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0194%3Acard%3D1)
represents a type: an veteren of war, whose actions consequently and
unjustly wrought upon him repulsion, judgement and extreme
isolation. He was abandoned alone on a island where he saw no one for
a decade because the inconvenient stench of his wounds would not
permit Agamemnon and the Greeks to honor the Gods. Until a captured
oracle prophesied the Trojan War's conclusion rested upon the full
engagement of all Greece -- with even the support of the dejected
Philoctetes-type, whose story remained unknown -- then the war could
never be won.

### We Could All Be Philoctetes

Philoctetes and its interpretation is incredibly relevant in our
time. To me, Philoctetes represents dejected individuals of many
types, whose story and whose energy is inconvenient or difficult to
engage. There are so many people like this: those who need health
care, those who cannot live without social programs, those veterans
who cannot afford health care. Unless we engage these individuals,
gain their support and do so in the manner of Neoptolemy -- without
deception and empty promises -- we will never conquer what lies before
us in history. If we operate on the assumption that we can consign
figures tainted with the inconvenient truths of reality to islands,
but steal their support when we need it, we operate moving forward
with the assumption that it is OK to use figures, who must bear the
details of their life in solitude and in shame.

People use the energy of others towards some goals. This is how life
has always been and we all know it; this is why we must transcend what
has happened in the past. When the goals and objectives are shared,
this can be justified. However, this is not how life will be moving
forward. We must engage every single person. This is a revolution of
empowerment. We will combine our energy, using knowledge and wisdom as
a basis for bringing into phase everything that every single
individual has to contribute. There will be no one left behind.

### So, Tomorrow, Hope And History *Must* Rhyme

In bringing our energies into phase with one another and in operating
with an altruistic set of values, America and the world over will
combine our potentials, starting with the unshacklement of every
individual. When the narratives of history are in phase with
Platonically ideal myth -- the kinds of stories that inculcate strong,
heroic values systems in each new generation -- then these stories
empower us to stand fearlessly against any challenge. Regardless of
the personal cost, it is our values that matter; that is what we fight
for and we know how our heroes would do it. The narratives of our
future history must amplify hope and reason with a story that
underscores humanity's conquest over greed, lust for power, and
meticulously crafted ignorance, in spite of the odds. Power from the
people: every person in this world is a chance to contribute towards
the advancement of society and towards the uplifting of every one of
us.

When we wake up in this new world, our story will form a collective
historical narrative of cooperation, illumination and societal
actualization. Sociopolitical currents around the world must lend
themselves towards societal
[metempsychosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metempsychosis). Unrestrained
chaos -- without the metaphysical jujitsu of those antifragile
mechanisms to align any and all energies -- exacerbates traumatic
turbulence whose energy creates catastrophe, taking another eye for
every eye. This would end with centuries of a new dark age wherein the
forefront of all memory persists a neodeluvian narrative.
