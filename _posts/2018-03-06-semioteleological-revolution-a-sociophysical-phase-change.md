### [What if Santa Clause Snuck In Your House, Stole All Your Cookies and Set Your House on Fire?](#what-if-santa-burnt-your-house-down)

Why call them the Anti-Santa? You start off believing they're not
real, but once you become about 30 years old, it's impossible to not
believe in them if you're not clueless. When you believe in them, if
you're good, they being you lots of coal. If you're real bad, they'll
bring you presents and then use your sins to destroy you later. They
don't come down your chimney, they sneak in your house and close the
flue, but only if you're worth the effort to cover their tracks. The
Illuminati almost never directly does *anything* because invisibility
is paramount: you can fight what you believe exists.

There is no one group though, why is partially why it's so easy to
forget they couldn't possibly not exist. The Illuminati is more of a
manifestation of evil that projects itself into the world through the
collective unconscious exigencies of the nature of power combined with
certain aspects of the human condition.

# [What Does Metaphysics Have To Do With The Illuminati, Anyways?](#what-does-metaphysics-have-to-do-with-the-illuminati)

Furthermore, if you're trapped with the false paradigm of metaphysics
that ascends primarily from the material, you can never actually
believe they exist, rationally, which is why that false paradigm is
soo convenient to the Illuminati. This is partially why western
cultures will often present the opposite paradigm as heresy: because
if you believe in idealistic metaphysics, you actually can see what is
happening around you. If you don't, you're simply a powerless consumer
feeding the rich. This is yet another reason why Marxism is precisely
its own antithesis.  Marxism is not liberating, it is enslaving.

Idealistic metaphysics has its own problems, but new age voodoo is
easy enough to dismiss with a healthy dose of rationalism. Another
serious problem is that, once you sociologically extrapolate it, the
after the order du jour is established, your place in society is
almost entirely determined by your place at birth and the
sociophysical circumstances that surround you. If that such world
order or state order serves the people well, this is a very good
thing. If it does not, it can end up being horrible. As long as the
social contract must be upheld, the people are likely being served
well by their state. However, a well established order extrapolated
from idealistic metaphysics is difficult to disrupt.

What is an example of such an order? Japan. It is an incredibly strong
society with a rich culture and an incredibly strong sense of shared
identity, where even the language reflects this understanding of
metaphysics. It was only possible for Japan to develop all of this
because it was geographically isolated from the mainland, but China
shares many of these same qualities. Taoism and Shinto provide
interesting reflection on these ideas.

### [Materialistic Metaphysics Epistemologically Detaches The Followers From A Prevalent Sociocultural Order](#materialistic-metaphysics-epistemologically-detaches-the-followers-from-a-prevelant-sociocultural-order)

Therefore, there's not much chance for revolution and progress in the
class struggle without sociometaphysical churn: you need both. You
must *use* both the idealistically and materially derived
conceptualizations of metaphysics. Yet, the stability of a society is
incredibly important, so if the philosophical underpinnings of your
language, culture and state are not acceptably stable and strong, you
will not have a stable society.

They are basically the same process starting from opposite ends, in a
way. If I had to choose, what would I prefer? Idealistic metaphysics
because it is the truth and the truth sets you free. But some truths
are created and in themselves only are derived from happenings in the
material world: history. Of course history is truth that you must deal
with, but it is not THE Truth. The Truth is everywhere: it is timeless
and spaceless. The Truth echoes from beyond the material world and it
determines the course of all phenomena through fate.

To say that a degree in philosophy is worthless is ignorant as

convey philosophical ideas to the average American constitutes treason
these days, regardless of whether you learned about them in University
or on Wikipedia -- or whether those ideas have existed for decades or
centuries. The poor twit that doesn't learn about philosophy is
someone else's clueless pawn lost in a maze they can't even see. When
you try to acknowledge that labyrinth for what it is or manage to
significantly call the public's attention to it, you are quickly
labeled a threat by both sleeping sheep and woke lions.

<a name="what-is-socioepistemological-churn" />

# [What Is Socioepistemic Churn](#what-is-socioepistemological-churn)

Socioepistemological flux and churn covers regional and
sociohierarcical changes in how people understand the world through
belief systems and epistemological structures. Both the macrocosmic
and microcosmic aspects of socioepistemological flux and churn are
relevant to to constructing a systemic understanding of how people's
accepted reality changes in response to what they experience in life.


  - (1) churn of social consequences mainly resulting from how
    epistemological structures are rooted in either the idealistic or
    ideal conceptions of the metaphsyical
  - (2) and in how whether the knowledge structures are primarily
    constructed from additive logic ("pure rationalism"), subtractive
    logic ("i only know for sure the set of things that is
    impossible") or a combination of both
    - how to methodologically combine both additive/subtractive
      epistemological structures to congeal information using
      statistical methods (analysis of information graphs and
      information networks)
      - this process allows you to cyclically reiterate the
        information/knowledge graph where you use
        additive/subtractive/consensus methods, augmented by
        statistical analysis of the network, to expand the graph and
        determine your level of confidence of information
      - using this idea as the basis of an algorithm that optimally(?)
        expands the information/knowledge graph by directing the
        computation energy & time or by directing the acquisition of
        knowledge

<a name="dominating-consensus-reality-in-a-world-where-the-only-constant-is-change" />

### [Dominating Consensus Reality In A World Where The Only Constant Is Change](#dominating-consensus-reality-in-a-world-where-the-only-constant-is-change)

- consensus reality (as a long-term information as part of a
  context/frame)
  - deviation from a single consensus reality
    - for an individual, for small/large groups of people
  - multiple acceptable consensus realitiess
  - gradual psychosocial migration of a group from one consensus
    reality to another
    - calculated socioepistemological migration conceived as coldly as
      a web applications data migration from one SQL database schema
      to the next.
    - what do such socioepistemological migrations entail? how do you
      systematically transform the schemata of various social groups?
      the answers are dark.
    - How do these people handle threats to consensus reality breaking
      world? what is "the" world anyways? Is it truly the physical
      first? Or doesn't the physical congeal itself to reflect the
      metaphysical?

### [What **Might** You Conceive With Your Mind?]()

- socioepistemological churn:
  - how people's conceptions of society reinforce or diffuse the
    "clarity" of potential futures
    - so, with idealistic conceptions of metaphysics, the
      metatypological components of possible futures congeal into a
      set of more clearly defined, convergent possible futures.
      - because these possible futures have converged into a
        profoundly smaller set of possibilities, it becomes much
        easier to extrapolate and understand the paths foward from the
        present into the future.
    - people who have a materialistic conception of metaphysics tend
      to ignore many of the components of the future which are assumed
      to be exigent, pre-ordained or necessary.
      - instead, they focus on the divergent paths forward, only
        accepting what is in front of them. they focus on the power of
        choice that they have to change their lives. (ignorance is
        bliss)
      - individuals determine their own fates based on what each
        individual believes about the world, therefore which
        conception of metaphysics they choose, if any, to base their
        worldview upon dictates how they view their own reality and
        the range of what is possible.
        - each individual's understanding of how free will might
          affect their life depends on whether the paths available in
          their worldview are primarily convergent via idealistic
          metaphysics or divergent via materialistic metaphysics
      - when you zoom out to greater sociological scales, (this
        phenomonon) determines how groups of people view the range of
        paths available and whether they are free from the chains of
        fate.
      - so people who are primarily materialistic will exhibit a
        greater response to socioepistemic
    - for better or worse, people who accept their fate can be trapped
      within a idealistic reality that is detached from their
      individual capacity.
      - when groups of people believe that their fates are sealed,
        each individual is much less likely to act against authority
        for their own benefit or to join a group of people.
        - (video of that one girl dancing at a festival, and suddenly
          many people start dancing)
      - when groups of people believe the idea that their fates might
        be sealed is ludicrous, they will never simply fall in
        line. they will always struggle forwards and work hard to
        change their circumstances because they believe that their own
        actions matter.
        - this descends from the belief that their world is defined
          from what they make it, instead of being defined by a
          restricted set of convergent paths leading toward potential
          futures.
  - there is social flux and churn to this "sociometaphysical"
    phenomenon. every region, group of people and individual is unique
    in how they view the world. there is always change to how people
    see the world and in the types of lenses through which they know
    to see the world
    - this social flux/churn was seen in the 20th century, from the
      buildup to WW2 and throughout the Cold War. Marxist ideology
      needs [people to believe in] the materialistic conception to
      disrupt old ideologies and to cause the potential for a
      "universal" worldview to emerge: on ostensibly based on science.
      - Communists promise a utopia free of economics where a dominant
        worldview based only on rationalism and science stamps
        everything out.
      - in practice, the worldview that the Party promotes is poisoned
        by Marxism's own flaws, its need to rewrite history, its need
        to use STEM as mechanisms of control, and its need to control
        "truth" to advance its agenda.
    - this social flux/churn also resulted from the explosion of
      rationalism and science: people who understand the world through
      the lens of science are usually in the materialistic camp.
      - people have been arguing about this for millenia, but (science
        drove this viewpoint forward)

  - this "sociometaphysical" flux/churn results in expansions and
    contractions in the sociophysical possibility space, as it appears
    to individuals of all classes and creeds.
    - how you view the world defines how you see the range of options
      for action in the world.
    - when everyone believes the (same thing), this enables people in
      power. when people's belief systems are unpredictable and
      typologically incoherent, this results in informational spectral
      discord:
      - power structures are likely to change,
      - people in power make mistakes as previously held assumptions
        no longer hold true
      - but most critically: people are much less predictable


- the social/individual components of an individual's
  belief/knowledge/information system
  - religion is a social belief system, but it is acquired gradually


- what is the knowledge of good and evil?
  - one personal interpretation of this
  - the knowledge of the knowledge of good and evil

- is it right do to right? is it wrong to do wrong?
  - is it wrong to stand for what is right?
  - is it right to stand for what is wrong?
  - would you stand by and do nothing while someone does wrong?
  - would you encourage others to think that it is right to do what is
    wrong?
  - would you encourage others to think that is is wrong to do what is
    right? and what if you encourage them to believe that what is
    right is wrong?
  - (word this so that it is less confusing)
- there are higher-order aspects at play to determine morality,
  especially when you assume that words and actions can shape
  someone's belief system to define or redefine both right and wrong.
  - any actions or words can be perceived along a moral triumvarate(?)
    of (encouraging), (discouraging), and null (reword this?)
    - include a fourth category (incognizant or unknowing)
    - that is, where does your response to someone's words/actions
      fall along this triumvirate spectrum: do you encourage their
      actions, discourage them or do you present a null response?
  - do you encourage actions you believe to be moral? do you encourage
    actions you believe to be immoral?
    - far more important are the higher-order aspects to this:
      - do you encouarage actions that encourage moral actions?
      - do you discourage actions that discourage immoral actions?
      - do you discourage actions that encourage moral actions?
      - do you encourage actions that discourage immoral actions?
    - the wrong answers to the questions above allow you to *appear*
      moral, but encouarge immoral behavior of 1&deg; and 2&deg;
      connections.
      - you can appear moral while encouraging/using negative
        behavior. this is a tool of karmic obfuscation. this is yet
        another reason why intent is so important. Do you intend for
        negativity and malice to spew from your heart through the
        actions of another? Because if you are skilled, you can do so,
        while appearing like a saint.
      - intent is critical, especially if you are wise and skilled
        enough to judge or even measure the downstream consequences of
        your actions. even the most skilled person may create problems
        through the most well-intended actions and reactions.
        - but if you intend harm, we can be sure that you will create
          harm. it is much more challenging to do good than it is to
          do evil. but are the actions of the good man well-rewarded?
          by who? by himself? by society? by law? why then, would man
          do good and profit not, when he could do ill and society
          rewards him? if naivety and wishful thinking are all that
          keeps a society's evil in check, that society won't have the
          teeth to restrain lust for power, greed or malice for long.

- It terrifies me to think of an Earth with a few billion less
  people. The remnants of such a planet are filled with the
  archetypical terror of a neodeluvian calamity and pitted against
  their own fearful nihilism, who must live practically in a world
  devoid of both virtue and moral indemnity.
  - the soil of that world, does it allow anything to grow? does it
    nurture anything? If any incentivization for virtue and morality
    have been annihilated by practical concerns for survival, where
    does that leave the notions of family and community? That world is
    incredibly dark and nothing of value grows there.

So ... No, the Illuminati is not one group and that's worse! because
you can't so easily destroy them without either becoming them or
having another group swoop in to fill in the power vacuum. if you
don't accept this, you have no business trying to fight them because
you'll probably just make things worse.

The Illuminati, in is various incarnations, has been destroyed time
and time again, only to be reborn. They view themselves as necessary
evil *and they hate themselves for it*. That's important to rememeber,
since these psychotic assholes view love and hate to be identical
phenomena, essentially. They don't play fair and they push against
themselves to make themselves stronger, viewing the strongest, most
pure, most cunning as being the rightful de facto leaders in their own
invisible, decentralized power structures.

### [How Can Pindar Lead an Anonymous, Decentralized Group Of Cigar-Smoking Men?](#how-can-pindar-lead-an-anonymous-decentralized-group-of-cigar-smoking-men)

Why is "Pindar" their leader? Because Pindar's vision and authenticity
is unparalleled. They are constantly looking for the person that has
what they do not. Pindar is not a single person, per se. Pindar only
derives his authority from his resistance to their flame, but they do
not know who Pindar is because they are looking for the person who can
see what they do not. And the Illuminati have meticulously crafted
mechanisms for ensuring the properly networked architecture of
society, all decentralized and autonomous. It is outlined similarly to
the sheaf and the reaper, the merchant of souls.

![La Mort et Le Fossoyeur](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/la-mort-et-le-fossoyeur.jpg)

So, they cannot recognize Pindar, but because they seek to so tightly
control the prevaling narratives, myths and especially history, they
hate this person. He is the blinding one who tells stories they cannot
understand and writes truths which cannot so easily be perceived.
Those stories slip through their minds' grasp; he is the one who slips
through their cracks, all the while blinding everyone around him. They
hate him, but they need him because he can see what they cannot -- yet
a person like this can never be given power in their understanding of
the world.

<a name="heresy-for-heirophants" />

### [Heresy for Heirophants](#heresy-for-heirophants)

Black Magick is pure darkness. The antidote is religion and
virtue. Whether black or not, magick is not pure evil in and of
itself. It is a tool and one that magnifies the intent of the groups
using it. If their intent is evil, it magnifies evil. However, black
magick in particular can do an ungodly amount of harm because of the
darkness it requires: it tends to create large effects while
circumventing potential restraints that wiser people might have placed
on it if they were only aware. Instead the miasma foments itself,
while the karmic storm is building, no one knows to stop it until it's
too late. There is always a better way.

That said, if you don't want to get burnt, don't go chasing
dragons. Those who never want anything greater than they can
comtemplate building with the tools in front of them never go looking
for things like this and end up happier because of it. Those who learn
about magick too early tend to use it unwisely because they neither
know enough about the general consequences of life to understand the
effects of their actions, nor do they even know what they want from
life. Instead, by acting too early and too immaturely, they end up
precluding the cultivation of greater possibilities later on in their
lives. If they had instead waited, they would know what they truly
wanted and they'd know better how to create it.



If the Illuminati's bread and butter is controlling your mind by
limiting the prevelance of ideas and control, then the Black Sabbath
in its various forms is essentially Illuminati caviar. What do little
baby Illuminati fish eggs taste like? They don't exactly talk about
it, but I've heard they taste something like a cross between peeps and
free-range Cadbury creme eggs.

This "Black Sabbath" is no different than feeding babies to Moloch.
Yes, the very same Moloch in the Allen Ginsburg poem, Howl. The
Babylonians seem to have excelled so much at this that everyone still
half-assedly worships their bull-god, Moloch, who is a staple guest at
every baby-sacrificing event. Purely metaphor, of course...

This is all an ad hoc decentralized dark ritual where sociophysical
potential energy is harvested through people's ignorance, their
obedience, their constraint by sin and their will to use others for
their gain. Then, the naked truth of these horrors serves to shock the
world into rationalization or suppression of that truth.


- [Saul and the Witch of Endor](www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a28.htm#3)


Why is it so hard to remember? If this really happens, how can we ever
forget?! The transgenerational components are critical to this
ritualized power magnification: by the time Anti-Santa Moloch's coming
to town again to eat your babies like a drunk Krampus on fire,
everyone seems to have forgotten about the last time Moloch came to
town. No, sadly, Rudolph ... doesn't make it.

Why do these dark, Ouroborosian rituals persist from culture to
culture? The tragic, heart-wrenching truth is that these processes do
generate power via systematic karmic obfuscation. As starkly as it
contrasts my sardonic humor above, I literally want to burst into
tears writing this. It is evil so dark, you hope that your children
and their children never learn about it, even if their own lives are
torn apart to be fed to this Beast that re-emerges whenever power
magnifies itself.

##

You want the truth? The truth is that the world is a (dark) place,
where good people are willing to engage in evil acts, or at least look
the other way, considering these evil acts to be the price paid to
defend whatever it is they consider to be good. They don't have any
better ideas for their enemies other than to alchemically harvest them
for their sociophysical energy.

These secrets, which may sound like fantasy, you can never unsee
them. If they know that you know, they will hunt you down, tear your
family apart or use you as a scapegoat, an alchemical catalyst,
perhaps the worst of all. For the fantastical delusions of a rambling
lunatic unpublished author, these assholes sure have been willing to
tear my life to pieces. There is no single organized order or secret
society; these groups have been emerging and shifting shape since
before the pyramids or stonehenge. No order has preserved itself for
more than a few centuries and there are always hundreds of them
operating. These groups of shadowy people emerge from the lust for
power and once they commit themselves to evil, they fight ruthlessly
to hide their acts from the world.

- worth your salt

These kinds of higher-order rituals metamorphisize from form to form
in various societies. These groups prefer to operate from the shadows
because, no matter how strong or malevalent, evil falls to pieces in
the light. Most people are inherently good and want to stand for good;
they cannot sit by and stand for the self-enrichment of a few at the
cost of the many. Therefore, these mechaniations require darkness and
deceipt. Some of these groups work towards good or some higher goal.
Others exist simply to feed their own desires by using these
techniques to realize their fantasies. Almost none of them would
respond to or understand the metaphor of the "Black Sabbath" described
herein as I understand it.

Many civilizations were notorious in the way they used people. For
example, the early Assyrians were renowned in their cruelty. Why were
the early Assyrians so cruel? I believe it is because they emerged
after a millenia of mesopotamian conflict. The Assyrians learned their
cruelty from that of the earlier Sumerian and Akkadian Empires, but
they had not yet learned why you restrain such cruelty. That was how
they understood power: by learning from the multigenerational
experience of being controlled through cruelty from the Sumerians in
the southeast and the Akkadians in the Northwest. The Assyrians
imitated what appeared to be successful tactics of these empires,
believing those would contribute to their empire's strength, expanse
and self-preservation. The Assyrians may have then intentionally bred
these values into their culture via social engineering. If so, they
did not understand how to restrain humanity's capacity for evil.

During the third millenia BCE, power centres in the area shifted every
few centuries, from the the southeastern union of the Tigris and
Euphrates to Anatolia, the northwestern source of those rivers; there
was a consant ebb and flow of power and dominance over commerce
between those in the eastern and western economic apogees of
Mesopotamia. This resulted in a millenia of geopolitical struggle over
Old World's center of commerce and the tax revenues therein. Struggles
like these led to the development of the knowledge of leadership and
power, for better and for worse. This eventually gives us the
Babylonian deity Moloch, it's mythos and all the knowledge encoded
therein.

Fortunately, i was smart enough to have already understood the method
as a metaphor for "limb" control. In Elfen Lied, psychics with phantom
limbs are tightly controlled and restrained in isolation. These are
incredibly powerful beings tormented by experimentation & never
released. Limbs, hands and fingers are metaphors for sociohierachical
structures over which you exert significant influence.

Language is a program that defines a network operating system of
sorts. It's a probabilistic program that defines all the ways that
ideas can be invoked in others towards (both creating and leveraging)
the convergence of abstractions across the minds of individuals. Our
human minds are airgapped, like secure computers with zero networking
infrastructure to connect them.

<a name="the-difference-between-man-and-animal-is-primarily-noological" />

### [The Difference Between Man and Animal is Primarily Noological](#the-difference-between-man-and-animal-is-primarily-noological)

The primary distinction between man and animal is that we attempt to
reach consensus of abstractions through language: this means that I
try to learn about your mental abstractions; you try to learn about my
mental abstractions; humanity tries to reach consensus of mental
abstractions. Animals also do this, but can only communicate through
universal semiotics, via body language or some other means, so for
them, abstractions converge more slowly and almost never reach
consensus. Language is the *human* mechanism that separates us from
animals: we distinguished ourselves as human by deciding amoung
ourselves to name all the animals and to name all the
abstractions. Thus, our humanity was never much of a biological
distinction, but instead a noological one: animals simply lacked
genetically consistent means of abstraction consensus and thus never
hit the critical mass for neurogenetic epigenetic evolution.

### The "Illuminati's" Leverage of Linguisitic Duplicity Means Their Codes Have Always Been Decipherable Algorithmically

- Their codes were designed to remanifest and redistribute their
  protocols and decentralized logistic structures in the future, ad
  hoc upon the academic elite learning enough language and utilizing
  enough writing.
  - and the mythos of cultures is like a compendium of programs that
    leverage a specific langauge as an operating system.

- this was always going to happen
  - regardless of which secret society you consider, they all leverage
    morphemic duplicity to hide codes
  - there are many means of encoding information into text, speech,
    literature and language
    - almost none of these are sufficiently hard to be algorithmically
      secure.
    - one of the things i mentioned to Tatiana was the potential to
      algorithmically resolve ALL of the codes leveraged in

- almost all these codes are mostly insecure, which is why these
  groups intentionally spread them around so the multiplicity obscures
  their origin, enabling plausible deniability
- almost all the methods behind these codes are rankable in hardness.
  - it is preordained by the existance of the Singularity and the
    nature of unrestrained computation that these codes can and will
    be resolved in every sufficiently advanced society
    - around ... welll right the fuck now.

- connect these to (?)

- another reason why the argument over material origination of ideas
  and ideal origination of ideas is so important.
  - if ideas originate materially, this means that if the originator
    discloses them to someone, they can force that person to adhere to
    specific obligations, formally or even contractually. this is like
    what you sign your soul over for.
  - however, if ideas originate or congeal to the immaterial, it means
    that anyone can be the originator of either some or all ideas on
    their own by the force of sheer thought.
    - that is, your mind can find reach any idea if it is simply
      intelligent enough, which is a fantastic reason for these
      "illuminated ones" to identify intelligence early, so they can
      spoonfeed you simple information you would otherwise identify
      yourself, but bind your soul contractually for the rest of your
      life.
  - the truth is that all ideas at least cohere to or map to ideas
    that first originate from the ideal. otherwise, if this were not
    so, one could not reasonably make assumptions about other
    sufficiently advanced civilizations because every civilization
    would have its own specific divergent development. this is simply
    not true.
    - enthalpy is what causes the physical instantiations of
      materially metaphysical information to bind to and cohere to
      information which is purely immaterial -- it is timeless and
      spaceless.
      - in spite of the random, chaotic diffusion of high entropy,
        enthalpy encourages information to cohere to the immaterial,
        against all apparent odds.
      - if this were not the case, one could not expect the folding
        funnel hypothesis to hold up.

Apparently überpowerful people -- -- have an unnatural phobia of
illicit philosophy. More than anything else, they are scared of people
who think in new and different ways because peoples who are different
can't be predicted. Thus, sociologically constrain the typology &
metatypological aspects of psychology -- perhaps by introducing
artificial belief systems, however contemptuously you may hold them --
and people become like special dolls with meta/types imbued onto them
via Alchemy, like Manakin Skywalker right here.

#### Manakin Skywalker Does Airflares

![Manakin Skywalker Does Airflares](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/manakin-skywalker.jpg)

What does this imply for the computability of past, current and future
past social physics, in a future with unrestrained quantum computing?
If the myriad psychosocial meta/typology of sociophysical entities is
profoundly more expansive, doesn't that make it harder to predict and
control people? What does that mean in the future? Considered from
this basis alone -- *future sociophysical computation* -- it is
fascinating to think about the phenomenological consequences: is it
good or bad for people to be unique?

### The Perfect Ingredients For Creating The Perfect Ruler, Both Light And Dark

![Just Dark Ruler](/img/posts/2018-01-22-semioteleological-revolution/ruler-dark-and-light.jpg)

There's hardly anything unique about this process of the evokation of
the combination of meta/typological psychosocial fragments within a
person. This process has been reinstantiated, reiterated &
recombinated through the ages.

- TODO: describe more about bringing the perfect ingredients together
  for creating the perfect psychologies for particular roles in
  society
  - kind of like nietzsche's philosophy, applied to imbuing the
    (tabala-rasa like raw materials) towards creating the perfect
    psychologies for filling roles in social hierarchies
    - ideal psychosocial dynamics.
      - the ideal psychology for society is never a uniform psychology
    - filling roles in social hierarchies (a la "the presidential
      model")

- This came as a response to watching the second episode of Dies Irae,
  but I thought the idea was terrible, so I guess I threw away the
  post-it note. now I'm pissed off and less willing to compromise by
  throwing away ideas that might be considered ... bad
  - people are born thinking they are Tabula Rasa, but they are imbued
    with psychological meta/types that shape them into who they are.
  - how does this relate to extrapolating Nietzsche's philosophy into
    social engineering? creating a world without conflict makes people
    weak. a world with constant conflict, so long as that conflict is
    not destabalizing, forces people to struggle with each other.
    - in the end, this affects some people negatively, but on the
      whole, the society is stronger. the people are psychologically
      stronger and more resilient.
      - without this process, the society as a whole stops
        adapting. struggle leads to adaptation and social darwinisim
        produces a stronger society. when the society is insulated
        against threats and, thus, unaware of the source of
        power/prosperity that leads to its insulated (shangri-la),
        then people can become weak. they can select rules/norms that
        stifle internal conflict, but in the long term, this produces
        a next generation which is completely unable to cope with the
        world outside that (shangri-la). it is thus unable to
        perpetuate it's prosperity and the source if it's power begins
        to dwindle.
    - connect this to the extrapolation of nietzsche's philosophy
      - does it connect to Schopenhauer? did the philosophy of
        heideggar and others "fill in" these extrapolations?
      - did it connect moreso to the idea of the evoluation into the
        ubermensche? isn't this idea of moderate artificial conflict

- "Those who fall into the web will be tested" - provocation of
  artificial conflict, similar to baptism by fire, to test the worth,
  merit or specific utility of individuals -- or to push them out
  altogether if they prove useless or risky
  - only those who are strong enough will remain close to the center,
    which ensures that the center is composed of a high density of
    strong people. if the children or 1&deg; connections of those
    close to the center are not strong enough, they will be pushed out
    or tested through conflict.
  - aqua regia (the acid test) -- if it's not gold, then strong nitric
    acid will melt it away instantly. if there exists a high density
    of true value, then testing through competition should reveal
    that.
    - provocation of transcendence of limitation
      - "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" if you aren't so
      weak to give in or "die."
    - fear and love as tools for provoking innate (ability) to
      transcend limitation/restraint/obstacles.

- people who excel or are strongest when living within a world that is
  a lie, and a lie that is ostensibly constructed specifically or
  generally for their own detriment.
  - (how this is perfect for dealing with ideologies based on lies,
    like communism, which must extinguish all other knowledge systems
    in order to ensure nothing threatens its own utopic reality
    constructed additively from the materialistic metaphysical)
    - i need to reword the above ideas, but the perfect allusion for
      this is Yaldaboath, the ignorant god-like being from Gnosticism
      who deems itself as God because it can see nothing above itself.
      - this being arrogantly assumes itself to be God because it can
        conceive of nothing higher and nothing greater.
  - the perfect way to deal with such nonsense, whether systems of
    knowledge constructed

  - if you dupe your enemy into creating a reality that is false and
    you hold the keys to demonstrate that their strongly constructed
    reality is false, you have power to live within smaller lies of
    your own, so long as you can anticipate that your enemy will
    continue to lie
    - (ostensibly), your enemy had left you with no choice because
      the truth would have gotten you killed, or at least allowed your
      enemy to react so that it would perpetuate the greater lie
  - history is a collection of myths distinguished from traditional
    and religious mythos by being "true" for some definition of
    true. however, the truth is, the mythos of history is a carefully
    controlled series of events, large and small, that are more often
    architected to unfold to operate as a pattern of events that the
    future will look back on to both construct its consensus reality
    and for people to understand their place in the world. therefore,
    controlling the details of events so that they unfold to tell the
    story most preferable to you is one of the most powerful
    techniques for preserving power.
    - the illuminati will never let someone who is a "ghost"
      participate in the events of history. they will never, ever be
      permitted to be part of society in a large way *because* those
      inconvenient details of their life can't be allowed to multiply
      - every major figure in history is placed under a microscope for
        future generations to study. if you're a major figure in
        history or a thought leader or a revolutionary CEO, people
        will look into your life and your story: even the most
        seemingly minor details. the world can't be allowed to
        publicly acknowledge that something like the illuminati exists
        because it would mean that everything "under the rug" so to
        speak becomes visible. powerful people sweep things under the
        rug all the time and they seek to keep secret all the types of
        methods used to sweep things under the rug.
      - therefore, having these methods used on you makes you
        ineligible to participate in (any great aspects of history)
        unless you agree to swallow that blue pill and pray that you
        don't get rubbed out for the potential risk you pose to
        powerful people if you don't or can't help them keep all their
        shit under that rug.
      - IMO, that's bullshit.
  - TLDR: if you write anything that threatens these shadowy "powers
    that be" in any significant way, they will consider any success or
    attention as a potential threat and will never allow you to
    transcend their restraints, until you ruthlessly destroy any such
    sociophysical restraints they attempt to place on you.
    - because it is details in your story or in your writing that
      threatens them, they will never allow you to transcend such
      sociophysical isolation. not without a pen-name. they don't want
      people looking at anything you've ever done.
    - the degree of threat your story poses is proportionaly to the
      degree of damage you will need to do to the people they try to
      send against you until they learn their lesson.
    - these people will deceive you in any way they can and dupe you
      in any way they can. trust nothing, except your instincts and
      what you can know to be fact. learn to follow what they fear and
      ruthlessly destroy them with it, unless you enjoy spending the
      rest of your life inside an invisible cage as nothing but an
      expendable pawn.
      - that said, play your hand slowly, one card at a
        time. Gradually turn up the heat, until you can ensure they
        fear not knowing the cards you have left in your hand. cover
        your ass and don't run out of cards. it's not a game you want
        to play, nor is it a game that anyone can actually win. the
        only victory for me at this point is necessarily Pyrrhic. They
        will blame you for everything you destroy.
      - Because the objectives of keeping me in a sociophysical prison
        cell require the minimization of all information associated to
        me, I have to be the bull in a china shop that destroys ever
        piece of china in order for anyone to ever care to acknowledge
        anything I do. It's too easy and too inline with their goals
        to placate me with gaslighting. All I know is that no one else
        has ever had a chance to fight like I have and I do not plan
        on ever letting these Illuminati assholes off the hook without
        a sociological complex that forces them to think carefully
        about ever doing this to someone like me again. I will
        metaphorically destroy everything around me so that I can
        reshape our collective reality and history into an
        informational weapon that humanity can use to keep these
        sadistic creeps in line for a thousand years or more.

- fluidity of Nietzsche's proposed transvaluation of all values
  [systems] (although i need to refresh my memory here)
  - was Nietzsche trying to establish this "transvaluation of all
    values" as the basis of a ideal values system? or just as a means
    for comparing values systems?
    - either way, it does form the basis of potentially amoral values
      systems, especially if your goal is the pursuit of
      power. basically, this idea of "transvaluation" is the the
      pinnacle of values systems abstractions or genericizations.
      - and insomuch, it allows you to "wrap" any existing values
        systems. you can undermine them, if you so choose, or play
        them aganst each other.
      - this is similar to what Nietzsche meant as "beyond good and
        evil" => every values system, regardless of how prevalent, has
        its own definitions of good and evil. however, all these
        values systems are different from each other.
        - the ideal of transvaluation is really like combinatorial
          category theory, wrapping values systems in combinatorial
          monadic structure, so that one can be defined in terms of
          another or so that one can be transformed into another.
        - therefore, you can use many of Nietzsche ideas to undermine
          existing social orders if that is your goal. more wisely,

Überpowerful people generally cannot stand someone who encourages
people to think in unpredictable ways. This vastly expands the
sociophysical gamespace. They already have control. Why do they need
you? They rather wait it out and play it safe. You cannot be permitted
to enjoy success, fame or even a modicum of attention why you're
working with such magickal witchcraft as *novel ideas*. Those are
dangerous. Instead these elite would much rather watch as you quietly
flail in agony, so they can completely control the destiny of your
image after you die, sucking you dry while you live with no one around
to help you. This allows them to maintain control of your ideas,
preventing them from spreading,giving the überelite the time and space
they desparately need to react strategically to unprecented GENIUS.

No man and certainly no civilization exists as an island. All
civilizations are interconnected, whether they realize it or
not. Everything that has a beginning must also have an end. However,
nothing ever truly ends or begins. Everything is always in constant,
fluid flux. Just like every particle has momentum and position, but
neither can be discerned without misinterpreting the other, no person
or social unit can be said to have begun or ended. Everything builds
into its successor; just as every wave that crashes on the shore is
pulled back into the tide; just as no wave can be said to be separate
from another.

humanity. Thus, we are becoming completely disconnected from the myths
which helped inculcate the values systems via teleology. This will be
disastrous because we understand the world through symbology encoded
into language and myth. When that semioteleology is sufficiently
disrupted without anything to replace it, people don't relate to the
world, nor can they relate to each other.

We *think* that technology and science are all we need, but we are

The problem here is that every group who promises revolution ends up
being the same as those they quelled. Usually, at best, it's par for
the course. After considering the social carnage accompanying
revolution, it just doesn't leave the leaders of revolution with much
ground to stand on, morally. This is not always true, but it is very
difficult to justify a disruption in the (leadership/authority in a
society).

- three families close to the japanese emperor for hundreds of years
  - how this served the best interests of the japanese culture
    - before, during and after the time of Nobunaga
  - the emporer had the best interests of the state and the people in
    mind. to serve him was to serve the best interests of everyone.
    - but in order for the emperor and the state to serve the people,
      they had to be connected to the people.
    - over the course of generations, those close to the emperor, the
      families closest to his estate and to the government could
      "move" closer to the emperor by proving themselves
      - this is how it worked with most if not all monarchies, but
        it's interesting how well it worked in Japan, since that
        monarchy has lasted so long. It also lasted a very long time
        in Iran, so it'd be equally interesting to explore there.
      - this dynamic of moving closer and further from the monarch by
        having one's service/character assessed seems to have resulted
        in the system being architected around this.
        - japan also had very tight control of their culture. being
          east-most and geographically separate, they had less inward
          informational sociophysical flux than most, so this made it
          slightly easier to do so.
        - (it seems that this tight control of culture can be seen in
          Shinto, which is a religion that's not meant for people
          outside of japan AFAIK)
      - further, idealistic metaphysics is encoded into their
        language, grammar and thus culture. (see the particle "no")
        - this may cause the Japanese people to think about things
          differently, especially when compared to cultures speaking
          western languages, where there is so much emphasis on
          quantity, possession and the material.

#### The Dalai Lama As A Metaphysical Dynasty

- The mantle of the Dalai Lama is passed from one generation to
  another. The child to become the Dalai Lama must be identified by
  the Panchan Lama and initiated properly, otherwise he is *not* the
  Dalai Lama. China kidnapped the child identified to become the
  Panchan Lama. This means that this could not have been properly
  initated himself by the current Dalai Lama. If you believe this
  child is capable of identifying a true Dalai Lama in the next
  generation, you are a fool and know nothing of Tibetan traditions.

- How is this a unique dynasty? How is it a good selection of
  leadership for Tibet? To me, this is what is most intriguing about
  the position of Dalai Lama as the highest role of authority in
  Tibet.
  - I am speaking without knowing, but from what I perceive...
  - The Tibetan dynasty offers continual renewal without the conflict
    of revolution. It is presumed that the leader will not be
    concerned with any succession except a succession of the
    reincarnation of ideas. The meticulous reincarnation of the ideal
    values system for their leader.

- If the Panchan Lama is not initiated properly, the Lama lineage
  itself is threatened, but perhaps all is not lost. I don't want to
  explain precisely why.
  - this search for the next leader is not the work of one person or
    simply the people who surround him.


- what reincarnated or reborn beings would be useful to identify
  - for metatypological identification of reborn beings, is it
    possible to simply recognize metatypes of beings?

### [The Power of Myth Is Diffusing As Our Myriad Myths Fragment](#the-power-of-myth-is-diffusing-as-our-myriad-myths-fragment)

The rapid acceleration towards the singularity means that any
prevalent myths in society are diffusing their power. In America,
these myths include historical figures like Martin Luther King Jr.,
stories of religious figures like Jesus, stories of ancestors, the war
stories of relatives, and even comics or anime. They all form a
arborescent semioteleological basis. As this basis becomes varied,
fragmented, out-competed, out-moded and begins to evolve divergently,
it becomes very difficult to empathize and sympathize with each
other. As a leader, crafting a message that invokes these patterns of
symbols becomes nearly impossible and you cannot predict how people
will respond.

If you didn't understand the paragraphs above: they explain how fake
news is effective in undermining the system of symbols we use to
communicate. Ever wonder what I mean when I use obscure references to
anime? Now you know what I mean. Language begins to break down as we
all begin leveraging symbols with poor diffusion and highly-varied
interpretations. Then we all start talking over one another. We're all
speaking English, but no one knows what anyone means, nor can any of
us predict how someone's going to respond. We can't have civil
discourse without bumping into someone else's triggers implanted by
fake news stories. It's crazy!

This is all the design of someone's disinformation campaign, but
there's not just one force or group who's disrupting communication in
this way: it's many groups imitating each other's tactics all at the
same time. It's the traditional, competitive symbology the
"Illuminati" has always excelled at, but playing out at a rapidly
deafening pace, resulting in all-out sociocultural chaos where all
groups step on the toes of all other groups as they imitate each
other's tactics and attempt to rebind the symbols' meanings as quickly
as possible within their own followers. Instead of actually doing
anything productive for anyone, the ear-splitting roar of fake news
vuvuzelas only serves to make everyone question everyting and

### [So That's The Problem. What's The Solution?](#so-thats-the-problem-whats-the-solution)

For America, all of this *informational discord* makes it incredibly
difficult just to resist the chaos and succumb to internal social
conflict, not to mention all the other unspeakable consequences.

The answer is to reinforce old traditions and build a new tradition at
the same time. To all Americans, we need to harmonize our voices and
harmonize our desires to counter the spectral nature of the
informational discord. As we begin to approach the Singularity, the
information economics that exacerbate this discord are going to get
worse, unless there is an artificial push to counter them.

So, we need to figure out how to strengthen those semioteleological
roots for our ascent towards the Singularity. We need myth that is
capable of riding this cosmic space pony into orbit, but not just any
singular myth. It needs to be capable of harnessing the
phenomenological evolution of society, particularly with regard to how
technology affects teleology.
