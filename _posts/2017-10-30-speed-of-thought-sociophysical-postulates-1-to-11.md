# [Emulation of Ancient Thought: Penultimate Metacognition](#emulation-of-ancient-thought-penultimate-metacognition)

There are countless aspects of life that ancient people understood
more clearly than we do today. In many, standing on the shoulders of
giants has yielded crippled versions of ourselves because we were
always molded and die-cast by a typology of life experience now
*decimated* by technology.

<a name="into-the-tragic-comedy-of-fate-i-cast-myself" />

### [Into The Tragic Comedy of Fate, I Cast Myself](#into-the-tragic-comedy-of-fate-i-cast-myself)

![Medea -- from Fate! Jesus Christ!](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/fate-caster-medea.jpg)

For the powerful, this is desirable. They can sell us technology to
solve our problems, while our growing dependencies on it
short-circuits the types of life experience that imbue our worldview.
In some ways, this makes us easier to control. We simply do not have
the same sheer drive that powers those of us who have learned through
pain and all the simple joys we'll never know. For all its benefit,
power and utility, Technology can never replace this value of the
struggle. The societies who artificially maintain these mechanisms
enjoy prosperity *and remain strong*.

### [A Marathon and Thermopylae for the Spartan](#a-marathon-and-thermopylae-for-the-spartan)

At the battle of Marathon, the Greeks defeated the Persians. News of
this victory was so critical that Pheidippides ran over twenty miles
to bear news of it's victory. Every marathon you run is part of a
millenia-old celebration of being the first to deliver a message.

What's the value of a message? How does cheap and free transmission
affect us? How does it lead to progress? The power of a simple message
unimpeded can change the course of civilizations. At Thermopylae, the
brave acts of hundreds of Spartans struck fear into the heart of
Persians and funneled vigor into the hearts of Greeks to rise up and
resist the oncoming hordes. Would this envigorating effect have been
possible if not for the story? *What if it couldn't be told?*

### [Novel Types of 21st Century Territory and Their Thermopylaean Chokepoints](#novel-types-of-21st-century-territory-and-their-thermopylaean-chokepoints)

The importance of Thermopylae to the Spartan victory was their
tactical utilization of the territory. It's the greatest story of
deception leading an army to a chokepoint. Today, with information
warfare, sociohierarchical conflict, economic warfare, there are many
novel kinds of territory. For each type and metatype of sociophysical
territory, where are the imaginable chokepoints?

### [An Eden Of Sociocultural Experimentation, Borne From The Idiosyncracic Geography of Greece](#an-eden-of-sociocultural-experimentation-borne-from-the-idiosyncratic-geography-of-greece)

During the first millinea B.C., a confluence of Greek technology,
culture and geography, encouraged a philosophic exploration of human
life. In particular, the Greek city-states flourished at a time where
reflection on the structure of society itself was encouraged, where
its evolution occured at a rapid pace and operated long enough without
being domineered by an external force. This itself wasn't unique, but
we managed to maintain their literary tradition. In doing so, we
preserved the best record of this phenomenon in Western history.

#### Socrates Engaging the Greek Agora In Philosophic Debate

![Schizophrenic Socrates' Added Nothing of Value To Society With His Constant Akathisia](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/socrates-agora.jpg)

<a name="social-and-informational-thermodynamics-and-convexity" />

# [Social and Informational Thermodynamics and Convexity](#social-and-informational-thermodynamics-and-convexity)

In the ancient world, population growth and movement was tightly
coupled to economic opportunity, constrained by resources, and bounded
by geography. Population quantity drives the total quantity of
information and increases the rate at which innovations occur via the
network effect. Population density increases the rate at which
information moves in those sociophysical networks.

Imagine humans as particles with random motion whose individual speed
of vibration depends on available vehicles of transit, intended
destination, resource distribution and other factors. The particles
vibrate in patterns, almost certainly originating from some home point
and returning to it every day. When these particles hit the ocean at a
port, they accelerate like sound hitting a solid barrier, assuming
these people have ships and sails.

<a name="thermal-convection-of-information" />

### [Thermal Convection of Information](#thermal-convection-of-information)

Imagine the sun rising in the Far East. It heats up the air and water,
giving us wind and ocean currents, but doesn't its sociophysical
energy also reverberate through humanity? As the world turns each day,
there is random motion moving from the east to the west, driving
social interactions. Pushing through the noise are faint, low
frequency waves of cultural information rippling over and reflecting
between geographic features. Vacuums of low population density taper
this resonance. Between the centers of civilization, the dispersion of
information is strained through translingual membrane, limiting the
number of social connections over which information can cross. These
metaphors are not perfect, as behavior was not coordinated and our
modes of transportation were limited throughout history.

#### Land of the Rising Sun: Low-Frequency Sociophysical Currents Emerge from the East

<a name="humanitys-measures-of-connectedness-vary-geographically" />

### [Humanity's Measures of Connectedness Vary Geographically](#humanitys-measures-of-connectedness-vary-geographically)

Consider the human population distribution of 5,000 BC. At this time,
we had dispersed from Africa through the Middle East and around the
Black Sea to India, Europe, China, Indonesia and the Americas. At that
time, was there a region more connected than others? The most
connected region was the Middle East. And people in regions less
connected?  Those in island nations or beyond the tropics of Cancer
and Capricorn, both of which would incidentally be more likely to
understand the spherical shape of the earth.

<a name="mesopotamia-and-mesoamerica-the-old-world-connectivity-maximums" />

### [Mesopotamia And Mesoamerica: The Old World Connectivity Maximums](#mesopotamia-and-mesoamerica-the-old-world-connectivity-maximums)

As for the Middle East, its high degree of connection, its proximity
to geographic chokepoints and its access to large swaths of ocean
surface area gave it an almost unparalleled economic advantage, which
only grew as time marched on. This region had the shortest actual
distance to the most number of people, and access to the largest
social graph neighborhoods, depending on how you measured it. When
people are more widely spread out, it is more rare to have large
2&deg; and 3&deg; networks, which conferred major advantages. Those
with wealth could finance transport and delegate action, which further
helped expand those networks.

The shifting power centers of Olmec, Maya, Inca and Aztec repositioned
the Mesoamerican nexus of connectivity. Why? Strategic control over
the Panamanian isthmus conferred the same economic and sociophysical
benefits as control over the Mesopotamian region. The power centers
shifted in America, just as they did for the center of the Old World.

<a name="north-korea-as-a-global-minimum-of-connectivity" />

### [North Korea as a Global Minimum of Connectivity](#north-korea-as-a-global-minimum-of-connectivity)

North Korea is an example of a major concave depression in
sociophysical graphs. This leads to restricted economic growth and
almost total disconnection of the populace from the outside. Both of
those lead to poor decisions by the North Korean leadership. They are
so disconnected from the rest of the world, coupled with internal
policy to ruthlessly quash all information contradicting state policy,
that their upper leadership isn't allowed to question the highest
leadership.

If the range of 2&deg; neighborhoods of North Korean citizens is
compared against other nations, you'll find that it is incredibly
limited when compared to similarly sized populations. Proportional to
their population, they might be the *most socially-restricted nation
on earth*, which is unbelievably depressing. Pictured below is a graph
visualization of what North Korea's socioeconomic connections might
look like. Alternatively, you can relabel North Korea as "Me" and the
Int'l Economy as "American Society."

#### Graph Visualization of North Korea's Economic Connections

![Economic Disconnection](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/north-korea-disconnected-2.jpg)

How can you compete in the global economy if your regime prohibits
communication with the outside and punishes dissidents with three
generations of family persecution? How can you export products if your
citizens cannot freely establish relationships with people and
businesses in other countries? NK cannot belligerently flaunt
international norms for something as critical as nuclear weapons. The
NK regime undermines its own potential development of exports and
economic competitiveness by pursuing such a dead-end strategy while
caring nothing for realistic economic development. Until they turn
around their nuclear programs that endanger international security, NK
will continue missing out on the greatest period of human development
because they're stewing over something that happened four generations
ago.

<a name="north-korean-paranoia-undermined-their-posture-for-economic-development" />

### [North Korean Paranoia Undermined Their Posture For Economic Development](#north-korean-paranoia-undermined-their-posture-for-economic-development)

The future of the world lies in the information economy and
information warfare. Today, what matters most is the sociohierarchical
territory and informational territory that sets you up to maintain
prosperity. How can you ever expect to compete in the information
economy with completely restricted access to the internet and
near-zero consumer adoption of internet-capable devices? You can't,
which begs the question: who is informing your leadership's long-term
strategies? In a digital economy, products are informational. NK
citizens simply can't be consumers or producers of content. AFAIK, NK
citizens aren't even allowed to have radios because NK paranoia is
stuck in the 1960's soviet mindset of information control.

<a name="all-significant-revolutions-expect-paranoia-for-their-violent-treacherous-transgressions" />

### [All Significant Revolutions Expect Paranoia For Their Violent, Treacherous Transgressions](#all-significant-revolutions-expect-paranoia-for-their-violent-treacherous-transgressions)

All communist revolutions expect such paranoia *and they use it!* Even
for those non-Marxist revolutions -- viz. all revolutions with
significant turnover of control -- the leadership expects that the
employment of pre-revolutionary subversion to gain sociohierarchical
territory involves dirty tricks with disgusting karma. So, they plan
on using it. But, in trying to undermine any possibility of dissent --
and by being disconnected from the world with poor strategy being
supplied from outside -- North Korea has left itself not unlike a
nation lacking ships to engage in maritime trade. Paranoia of
imperialism indirectly contributes much of NK's isolation. Even if it
does pull off being a pawn for initiating nuclear war, that only means
NK will be isolated even more. North Korea needs to come to the
negotiation table and we need to sort this out. The first thing that
must happen is total nuclear disarmament and the rest of the world is
infuriated that NK leadership expected to use nuclear weapons as
bargaining chips.

<a name="north-koreas-strategy-never-had-an-endgame" />

### [North Korea's Strategy Never Had An Endgame](#north-koreas-strategy-never-had-an-endgame)

North Korea's strategy has no endgame, other than becoming an international
school shooter. Since the 1980's, this strategy has left No hardware
platform for internet, no participation in the information economy, no
media creation tools, no training or education on those tools, no
content production, no culture export, no connections developed and
interactions with the outside are discouraged. How did the North
Korean leadership miss this? Because they artificially dampen all
signal that could be perceived as dissent, wavering, or retreat. This
enables the prolonged development of silent risk and massive tail
risk, as Nassim Tebar would probably put it. NK is actually far-left
with components of far-right ideology.

<a name="america-and-europe-as-a-modern-sociophysical-connectivity-maximum" />

### [America and Europe as a Modern Sociophysical Connectivity Maximum](#america-and-europe-as-a-modern-sociophysical-connectivity-maximum)

America, Europe and the West form a global connectivity maximum. This
gives us diversity and some challenges related to multiculturalism.
However, those issues must be overcome eventually and we did so
early. Further, our populations are inundated in collective
understanding of even cultural minutia via the encouragement of
connection to peoples of all ethnicity and culture. This starkly
departs from the traditional wisdom in the Art of War where you
insulate your culture from any external influence, yet in the modern
world, it results in perhaps the greatest advantage that we have. Why?
The world is one and always has been one. We must overcome these
issues at some point and we have, which has also made America and
Europe and other highly connected non-Western regions connectivity
maximums. This fuels our platform for economic growth.

### [Artificial Diminuation and Amplification of Information Yields Dangerous Self-Delusion](#artificial-diminuation-and-amplification-of-information-yields-dangerous-self-delusion)

Furthermore, we'll never find ourselves in an isolated fortress, which
is
[Law #18 of the 48 Laws of Power](https://48laws-of-power.blogspot.com/2011/05/law-18-do-not-build-fortresses-to.html). If
we do not artificially silence this diversity of signal, we can remain
apprised and aware of our nation and developments in the international
world. Instead, it seems we artificially mute signals on the basis
that they are different. Since people often become conditioned to fear
that which they don't understand, it shrinks the needles in the
haystack that are precious, distinct forms of information, which
should clue us into developments we must react to. In highly
permeable, tightly connected information environments, we are more
likely to receive those signals unless we enact policy to stimulate
widespread fear over anything that might be different. Some
information is dangerous, but we are throwing the baby out with the
bathwater.

<a name="the-birds-eye-view-of-social-physics" />

# [The Bird's Eye View of Social Physics](#the-birds-eye-view-of-social-physics)

When an eagle looks down, using it's impressive eyesight to soak up
what it can, does the world appear as 3D or 2D? Its perspective from
that height provides a dimensional reduction and the details it
absorbs enables it to see shapes and patterns emerge in individual and
social behaviors, unaware to the animals engaging in those
behaviors. Humanity might think itself peaking the top of the food
chain, but birds of prey are also elevated among the rest of animals
in many ways. This status creates the imagery and fuels the strong
symbolism that motivates the depiction of birds of prey in national
flags, as well as their prominent place in myth and culture. By
observing birds of prey from a distance, if you're lucky enough to see
one, you can indirectly glean information about your surroundings, if
you're wise and foolish enough to make those inferences.

### [Do You See What I See?](#do-you-see-what-i-see)

Sociophysical systems are usually too complex to yield perfectly
scientific evidence, these metaphors and metrics are invaluable tools
yielding philosophic insights. They sharpen our inductive reasoning
for social behavior and history, giving us options that will yield
concrete scientific evidence. Most social systems modeled with
physical components are incomputable, but computational social science
is harnessing these ideas today.[^pos-sensitive-propagation]

<a name="an-infinite-dimensional-generalization-of-physics-and-molecular-dynamics" />

### [An Infinite-Dimensional Generalization of Physics and Molecular Dynamics](#an-infinite-dimensional-generalization-of-physics-and-molecular-dynamics)

Information has a life of its own. Nowhere does this become more clear
than in social physics, which is a mathematical framework for modeling
idealized social behavior with physical constraints. The initial
revelations of social physics yield mind-blowing epiphanies for
structuring, objectifying and quantifying social interactions. The bad
news: almost every problem is incomputable. Still, one can extrapolate
incredibly useful insights from the mere philosophic exploration of
social physics.

<a name="a-19th-century-attempt-to-quantify-sociological-phenomena" />

### [A 19th Century Attempt to Quantify Sociological Phenomena](#a-19th-century-attempt-to-quantify-sociological-phenomena)

#### This Ain't Nobody's First Rodeo

Social physics was originally developed in the 19th century to
quantify sociological situations and particularly how the behavior of
players in social games are affected by the imposition of physical
constraints. It originally borrowed heavily from classical mechanics
and now overlaps with quantum mechanics, since non-deterministic games
are loaded with probabilistic mechanics. Social physics can help us
understand team sports, advanced
[swarm behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_behaviour), the
geometric mechanics of battle tactics, cocktail parties and the finer
mysteries of feng shui. Each of those activities is determined by the
physics of the space and the players in a social game with rules.
Though with feng shui, the game and players may be less clearly
defined.

<a name="how-does-the-information-schema-affect-the-spatio-temporal-computability" />

### [How Does The Information Schema Affect The Spatiotemporal Computability?](#how-does-the-information-schema-affect-the-spatio-temporal-computability)

If you begin modeling games where players have their own sets of
information, social physics is rendered irrevocably and hopelessly
incomputable, almost immediately. Each additional layer presents its
own challenges of tractibility and data structure countability.
Simulations that can be parallelized with a GPU have tight information
schema requirements. Knowing this, how do you identify what can be
modeled and made known? How do you structure an organization's
logistics and data collection requirements to efficiently model social
phenomena and information dynamics? What's the difference between what
can be simulated and what can be inferred via data science?
Specifically, what schematic components and strucural patterns
increase the space and time required for computation?

#### &#x2605; Do the players contain their own copies of information or is it shared?

#### &#x2605; Do instances of information adhere to a defined schema shared among all players?

#### &#x2605; Can the information schema be modified?

#### &#x2605; Can the information be known in totality for the game?

#### &#x2605; Can a player access their own information in totality or reflect on its schematic structure?

#### &#x2605; Do players need to make inferences based on the information schemas of other players?

From the short list above, it isn't clear which adds the most
complexity or how, but players almost always operate with incomplete
understanding in social situations. They can do so effectively because
they've been conditioned to develop sets of proactive and reactive
behaviors sidestep the issues of scale and complexity. The particular
tactics to handling or circumvent complexity create their own dynamics
for information in sociophysical games. Information overload can
negatively affect players. The topics pertaining to information schema
and information reflection add an incomprehensibly infinite degree of
complexity. For the mathemtaticians, yes, modifiable schemas with or
without reflection are definitely uncountable.

information, but better at balancing uncertainy and risk with
goal-seeking behavior. If the game being modeled is soccer or some
other team sport, there are subtle sociophysical micro-tactics that
can vastly improve team performance, such as ensuring visibility and
other mechanics of assessment and communication. If the team works
together and can share its understanding of the state of the field,
this can help immensely with coordinating tactics.

There are other physical aspects of soccer which are also modeled by
social physics, such as the typical FIFA 2017 stats: speed, energy,
skill, etc. The best players in the world can play together, but
unless they can read each other and anticipate the coordination of
tactics with limited signaling, the games will be reduced to the more
physical stats and positioning.

Social physics is distinguished from physics and simple models of
swarm behavior by providing a framework where players react to
informational components and dynamics emerging from information. This
framework starkly contrasts simple probabilistic models for social
behavior with its focus on the spatial components and particle
interactions.

# [Postulates of Sociophysical Systems](#postulates-of-sociophysical-systems)

Extrapolating from a basic assessment of the math, there are
implications and ramifications that attain preponderance, standing
above everything else.  Stubbornly clinging to ideology constructed
around fast-fading pyschosocial paradigms, novel sociophysical
phenomena instead remain unseen shadows whose origins in ancient
social foundations elude us: not for some innate opaque ignorance, but
for the lust to control knowledge for power. History has blessed
humanity with incidental inculcation of wisdom, channeled through
obvoluted teleology -- now rendered preterite by foredominant
postponderence. Tapped into leylines carved from bedrock, as these
[qanat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qanat) rapidly sublimate from
[Anamnesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamnesis_(philosophy)), our
utopic oasis will invisibly fade as a mirage.

By failing to fully understand sociophysical phenomena, by stubbornly
clinging to ideology constructed around fast-fading psychosocial
paradigms.  By refusing to allow adaptation, we fall victim to
Nietzche's danger of dangers. This is not to say that morality and
well-defined, top-down values systems will themselves be antiquated.
Quite the opposite: we need to reinforce those systems that already
exist, but augment them with agile, flexible and antifragile values
systems that can fill in the gaps. For their followers, any such
belief systems must unfold into values systems with strong unifying
force, arising from a basis for values sharing a common root of truth.

#### Magnetic Field Lines From Two Adjacent Electromagnets

![Magnetic Field Lines](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/magnetic-field-lines.jpg)

Today, the world needs everyone on the same page. In order to operate
cooperatively in more virtualized sociophysical systems, we must first
develop a clear understanding of their purely physical counterparts.
Psychological and sociological understanding has always been the
mostly useful knowledge, especially when there was little technology
and nothing to use for the construction of great works but the hands
of men.

Just as the laws of particle physics are modeled as objects
interacting energetically with shared fields, sociophysical phenomena
also operate with fields and energy. The difference is that social
physics is the ultimate abstracted generalization of physical laws and
thus, to say that it is infinitely more complex means you have a
limited conceptualization of infinities.

The most important shared field is the field of attention. In all
physical and virtual social interations, people want to know what
other people are interested in: they are asserting and measuring
perceived beliefs to mitigate the system's complexity. Imagine this
field in a physical example to entertain an idea of the maximal and
minimal strength of force on this field. You're at home, alone. Does
anyone know where you are? Is your behavior going to influence someone
else's behavior? No. Without internet, your impact on the shared field
of attention is nearly zero.

#### Semblable Magnetism Aligns The Orientation Of Nearly Every Fan's Field of Vision To The Center of Action

![Hockey Stadium](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/hockey-stadium.jpg)

Now imagine yourself at a concert or a football game. People exert
influence on the shared field of attention with their focus. Their
field of view, as it is perceived by other people, exhibits an effect
on the field of attention. People are always looking to see where
other people are looking. The laplacian of a field tells us how this
changes, when and where. So, at a concert or football game, if all the
people were particles, they would be magnetically aligned to the field
lines. At a concert or football game, there would be a nearly maximal
value for the deformation in the field.

<a name="mechanics-of-social-interactions-and-connections-are-physical-and-logical-but-increasingly-virtualized" />

### &#8855; &#8710; &#8968;ii&#8969; [Mechanics of Social Interactions And Connections Are Physical and Logical, But Increasingly Virtualized](#mechanics-of-social-interactions-and-connections-are-physical-and-logical-but-increasingly-virtualized)

Via these shared fields, people influence each other via sociophysical
energy exchange. These fields are mapped ontop of physical and logical
spaces and we can intuitively measure the flow of energy across
them. Unlike the electromagnetic field, these fields are individually
conceptualized, so there are infintely many of them and infinitely
many energy types. Moreover, equivalent exchange of energy is almost
never preserved. While there are mechanics of energy exchange and
transduction, the nonlinearity makes the conversion of energy types
difficult to anticipate.

These fields can be imagined as spaces with the potential to
facilitate sociophysical energy exchange -- with a strong departure
from physics: there is pronounced variation in the topology of the
spaces. There are fields with physically derived topology, graph
topology and any kind of conceivable topology. These are simply tools
for attempting to model what is far more complex than can ever be
known.

The importance of sociohierarchical structures has always entailed the
use of logical, non-physical components to strategize or anticipate
sociophysical phenomena. These topologies -- either fully or partially
derived from logical relationships between people, groups, or other
nodes -- form fields where the energy mechnics operate like electrical
circuits. These form emergent logical topologies, where the social
graph might be overlayed onto physically interacting particles.

Electrical networks are an example of physical phenomena with a
logical graph-based structure overlayed on top. When determining the
structure and components of circuits, would you first consider the
physical proportions of the components before considering the types
and composition of components? What happens when you remove components
like resistors or capacitors from series or parallel circuits? Does it
help much to first think about physically derived microphenomena of
the system, like the
[Skin Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect)? Or would you
start with top-down methods to examine the phenomenological end-goals
of circuit structure: whether it a logical network of components forms
an amplifier or a transformer?

In reasoning about these systems and the range of possibilities, the
resulting dynamics and mechanics are neither purely physical or purely
logical. By logically reasoning about the systems and gradually
accreting structure, we attain flexible, efficient skill to
combinatorially evaluate circuit structures to achieve a maximum of
phenomenological agility.

On top of the physical world, we have constructed technology that
facilitates instantaneous communication, starting with the telegraph.
This has rapidly progressed, giving us the phone system, the early
internet and culminates in nearly superconnected networks of optical
cable. The world is well aware this means the digital world is more
relevant than the physical. What we're not ready for is the pure
manisfestation of the metaphysical into the physical realm.

Today, almost all human communication is, in full or in part, being
conducted across this logical communication infrastructure. The
majority of artifacts of human interaction and human activity are now
purely or mostly digital. Most critically, the physical aspects of
sociophysical conceptualization, strategy and tactics are less
dominant. The virtual and logical aspects are instead being amplified
to such a degree whereby the physical is almost secondary. The
logically derived topologies, such as sociohierarchical structures and
relationships, now matter more than ever.

Superconnected communication infrastructure evinces novel conditions
of possibility for sociophysical phenomena humanity has never
encountered. Other phenomena will seem to be radical departures from
dynamics and mechanics we know and love in modernity. Therefore, our
generations should begin conceptualizing their world primarily in
terms of these logically and informationally derived spaces. Again,
these tools for strategizing and managing human interactions have
always existed in one form or another, but hidden from most. However,
this purely physical world is no longer the one we live in, but if we
do not retain our individuality, our humanity and our sense of
purpose, nihilism will rapidly corrode through any system structure,
no matter how antifragile.

#### CPU's Are like Metaphysical Copy and Paste

![CPU Chip Fabrication](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/intel-cpu-wafer.jpg)

What is the CPU? What does it represent? Mastery over physics and
solid-state chemistry? Doesn't it also represent mastery over logic,
math, GÃ¶del, Turing and especially [Von Neumann machines]()? Nevermind
that, it represents the manisfestation of all this knowledge into the
physical plane, whereby the metaphysical facsimilarly imbues itself
into the structure of matter. This is the physical reification of a
materialistic or idealistic conception of the metaphysical: a machine
capable of executing instruction sets, numbered according to

### &#8855; &#8710; &#8968;iii&#8969; [Power Describes The Rate of Energy Fluxing Through Sociophysical Networks](#power-describes-the-rate-of-energy-fluxing-through-sociophysical-networks)

When conceiving social circuitry, people, groups and roles all form
components in networks that conduct, magnify, time and regulate
sociophysical energy flows. Electrical components can be conceivably
form metaphors for a typology of social circuit network design.  In
such circuits, social energy flows through networks where all
components are connected. Disrupting any power flow and affects all
power flows. Changing, reversing, inserting, tuning the components
influences the flow of power and energy flux across the rest of the
systems.

#### Nietzsche, in Twilight of the Idols

> Even a rapid estimate shows that it is not only obvious that German

Perhaps using different terms, Nietzsche was attempting to explain how
the opportunity costs of both sociophysical energy investment or
alterations of sociohierarchical components. When conceptualized with
the language of circuitry, this becomes more clear. Did Nietzsche
understand what one can attempt to quantify with non-linear energy
mechanics? In such non-linear systems, energy equivalence is almost
never preserved.

Similar to power in electrical networks, sociophysical measures of
power are defined as the potential to trigger flux through social
networks and the rate of that flux. In this way, other metaphors can
be applied to power and information flows; voltage, amperage, logic
gating, albeit these operate in an extremely-high dimensional
way. Further, there is no comparison between the near infinite and the
infinite: infinitely dimensional models are functionally divergent
from their dimensionally-bounded linear counterparts. There is the
curse of dimensionality, but then infinite dimensional math imposes
profanity-inducing limitations...

#### Many Consequences of Sociophysical Energy Flux Can Be Imagined:

#### &#x2605; Physical Change

#### &#x2605; Sociohierarchical Change

#### &#x2605; Belief Structure Change

#### &#x2605; Change or Stagnation in Conditioned Behaviors

#### &#x2605; Informational Change

#### &#x2605; Informational or Hierarchical Schematic Change

So, then *potential for power* is defined as the capacity to project
these changes into the world and *action of power* is defined as the
rate of these changes, however enigmatic power may be to quantify,
since the infinite variety of energy and transduction pathways render
all intractible. Perhaps our inability to understand ourselves is a
curse; perhaps it is a blessing.

The forms above are base types of changes to sociophysical
structures as a result of the exertion of power. What we see in life
are reconfigurations of the above. That is, we see the likes of:

#### &#x2605; Informational Change Yielding Physical Change

#### &#x2605; Informational Change Yielding Eventual Schematic Change On A Social Scale

#### &#x2605; Behavior Change Yielding Long-Term Physical Change

In a tokamak, almost all fusion confined to local maxima of
turbulence. Since fusion releases immense energy, these high flux
regions destablilize adjacent plasma. The higher the rate of fusion,
the greater the magnetic forces required to contain the chaos in the
plasma. Recently, tokamak engineering has sought to overcome the
structural limits of the frame: the tokamak is required to host
magnetic fields so strong, it literally can't hold itself together.

The potential for power and sociophysical flux arises from beliefs of
nodes in the system, both actual and perceived. In this way, belief
and perception can almost independently create types of energy.

Particularly valuable to understanding power flows is the differential
of information available to nodes in the system. While information is
neither linear nor simple, it consistently diffuses from the region of
higher concentration to lower concentration. This could also be
envisioned in terms of charge differential: electricity flows from
areas of higher charge to lower charge. The nodes or cliques with
higher density of information hold the cards; they retain options in
disrupting currents or eddies of sociophysical state in networks with
lower information density, as well as those with spectral content that
appears functionally advantageous.

### Knowledge Is Power

If there is already complete disemination of some pieces of
information to a set of nodes, you have diminished the capacity to
influence or restructure those nodes through the titration of
information. These fluid dynamics analogies are overly simplified
because, again, everything is a lower-order conjugation of the above
higher-order forms.

Materialist metaphysics are blasphemous: information and knowledge are
preexistent metaphysical forms; they can be discovered and
rediscovered by anyone. When one uncovers them in isolation, but
doesn't understand the names for these discovered knowledge forms, it
challenges the powerful in their ability to recognize and regulate
that knowledge. So the powerful or their pawns, who don't truly
recognize substance -- but the names of substance -- consisently
underestimate people like this. In the midst of campaigns to project
disinformation into the lives of intelligence threats, these pawns of
their material desires blind themselves because they don't know true
substance and they NEVER did.

In the 21st century knowledge is free. What do you think that means to
the truly powerful, truly knowledgable few?

Those of us with potential to drive sociophysical flux are like
batteries of social captial. Economic flux operates similarly; capital
dissipates when utilized, resulting in problem of opportunity
cost. Who do you invest in and why? How do you make that decision?
Further, social energy does not preserve equivalence nearly as well as
financial capital, whose true value can be distorted by fluctuations
in currency markets. This increased disruption in equivalence is
driven by beliefs and perceived beliefs, which create and dispel
social capital. This amplifies the negative penalties of social
investment, when time or words are spent on pariahs and lepers.

Depressingly, there is little to be done done about information that
already exists: what is created can never be destroyed. Disconnection
is created by dis/information -- it can only be relieved through
inordinate investment of energy from peers. Therefore, those who seek
to create disconnection as punishment do so by evoking information
forms into someone's life -- then, they can attempt to sell the
solution: projection of information forms intended to disrupt the
disconnection. That's called a con.

Regional, national and global history forms the basis for a language
of ideas. Our collective understanding of recent events in history
constantly changes, with fewer changes after narratives settle into
the books. After a few decades, when it is clear how events unfolded,
schools and universities multiply iota distribution of historical
narratives. This results in spectral coherence, extending throughout
the global if these events are relevant and necessary to understand as
determining the course of history.

#### History is Written By The Victors

Traditionally, it is been very difficult to disrupt established
narratives, whose distribution reaches some saturation threshold.
Unfortunately, today, superconnected networks and decentralized
content distribution has reduced barriers to adversarial projection of
information. Newsfeed algorithms identify and market content primarily
based on semantic and morphemic similarirty to what you share and
engage with.

#### [Window Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function)

![Window Functions](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/window-functions.png)

Analogous to a window function, this contextual aperture for past
events and future expectations is rapidly expanding. It determines
what information people consider relevent for framing and reexamining
our perception of cause and effect. With this trend, the scope
historical events that we are willing to reevaluate is expanding,
becoming moreso preferential and strategic. This particularly
dangerous consequence of spectral decoherence is pretty much terrible
for all sides, especially those with something to lose.

Unless people work together, this incentive and capacity for
disruption exacerbates a critical dynamic to be defined soon, which I
have named the ablation of causality. Essentially, the ability for
[SOF](/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency.html#sentient-organic-forms)
to even form an understanding of causal relationships between events
gradually sublimates. We become permanently dependent on technology,
just to understand the relationships between events, both in public
and private life. This is a disaster of disasters, with no apparent
cause in sight; we are blinded by inundation and incomprehensible
complexity.

#### And Hope And History Will Rhyme

History, as the collective narrative we all share, is under seige by
disinformation run amok on superconnected networks. Socrates said myth
should be structured so that the younger generation's conception of
the world is shaped by the heroes they look up to. If history instead
becomes a weapon of information warfare, then this hurts every nation
and group. It creates a situation where there is no shared
understanding of the past.

In this terse
[Treatise on Entity and Agency](/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency.html),
three primary types of agency are defined, as well as concepts for
agency within more abstract entities. Therein are convolved all the
traits that dilineate an entity's quality of agency. These traits
fundamentally evince, negate or void the mechanics by which an agent
interacts with and signals entities in their local sociohierarchical
spaces.  Through networks of biological, intelligent
[SOF](/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency.html#sentient-organic-forms)
entities, their spatiotemporal collisions and interactions engendered
logically defined sociohierarchical structures. Through these
intermeshed circuits, dominant and highly-connected entities channel
their will, fluxing sociophysical energy to exert change.

The ability for concurrency in processing signal distinguishes the
quality of agency for biological and mechanistic entities, as does the
ability to simultaneously manifest oneself in multiple places in
space. This is the root of aphysical projection of will, long ago
circumvented by delegation via extended social networks. Still, until
telecom, an individual could only project energy in one place at one
time, bounding how quickly state changes could occur -- i.e. fraud
detection algorithms assume the ID for a physical credit card can't
simultaneously make purchases in Florida and Washington.  Similarly,
concurrency restraints on human behavior can identify online behavior,
since bots can project a high density of interactions from the
cloud. AAF beings are still mostly bound to completely virtual,
aphysical forms, but will fast evolve from AAF and PAF and vice versa.

#### The Death of Archimedes

![Death of Archimedes](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/death-of-archimedes.jpg)

Agents react to these dynamics by artificially amplifying the
perceived beliefs they want others to operate upon, proactively
creating their own games. This represents a hedge against domain
complexity, as well as the proactive projection of energy through
social circuits to gain knowledge about these social and informational
nodes: gradually resolving models for these nodes' proactive and
reactive behaviors, both conditioned and conscious.

When adversaries deceptively distort your model for directing
awareness and interacting, they do so to bind you down. If you are
gullible, they seek to make you more predictable, to prevent you from
developing pragmatic social models and to prevent you from operating
effectively. And most of all, they want you to feel shame or guilt for
employing what are healthy sociophysical tactics. They will even abuse
social engineering to warp the frames of people on a sociological
scale by projecting information via mass communication channels.

This is all an attempt to consciously and unconsciously hedge against
complexity to reduce uncertainty in the vastness of social physics.
Central to antifragile system operation is the need to reduce
uncertainty. By manipulating beliefs & perceived believes, agents with
significant power create the mechanisms for stability required by
antifragility. Widening the scope of complexity and variation greatly
expands intractibility in sociophysical chaos.

To mitigate this,
[antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility) design
philosophy applied to social systems will engineer logistics processes
to: assert risk, *guide potential problems* _away_ *from the
combinations of conditions that might set them off* and analytically
process *digitized* records with social data science. Proactive means
of generating dynamics in the system allows people to interrogate
their environment, making inferences about the true beliefs of other
agents in the system or about information they have access to.

![Curling](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/curling.jpg)

When these logistic process structures involve stringent secrecy,
coverups of mistakes, distortion of information and amplification of
disinformation, this may work sometimes or in most cases. However,
sometimes these factors contribute towards a system being blinded to
parts of itself, increasing the likelihood of undesirable
[Black Swan events](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackswan.asp). Not
all [Black Swan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory)
events are negative, but since it is their ineffability and poor
definibility which causes them to escape undetected as randomness,
then might the amplification of disinformation suppress the
recognition of an event signature that would have otherwise never been
a Black Swan?

The tendancy to amplify beliefs & perceived beliefs to encourage
consensus, discourage divergent beliefs & behavior, can render the
system simpler to understand and easier to manage, yes. However, the
system does not exist in isolation, nor is it wise to believe you can
covertly operate on the sociological organism, as though your secrecy
can be post-justified as variable control.

From an informal assessment of the mathematics of social physics, it
has become clear that it is critical to bound complexity. Obvolution
and allineation of information produces constructive interference that
artificially increases spectral coherence, which partly motivates
perpetuation of religion. This profoundly constrains the complexity of
sociophysical systems, enabling those in power to limit the "search
space" of possibilities. Throughout history, this desire to restrain
innovation and divergence has occasionally resulted in blind zeal,
judgemental attitudes and other horrible consequences.

None of that is justified, which is why we need to wake humanity up,
so we can choose to cooperate and form a collective basis. Otherwise,
our fallibility and susceptibility to the seven deadly sins will
foment conflict at a time of exponential turbulence. This simply means
we need to think about who we are and collectively decide on how our
culture should transform. If we do not architect artificial feedback
loops for antifragile constraint of difficult problems like these,
instability may become rampant.

At a minimum, spectral coherence of information is fundamentally
linked to cultural universals, their semiotic representations and
sociohierarchical convolution of teleology. These cultural universals
then form a kind of origin, centered around the origin of semiotics:
symmetry. So, we always have those universals in common: we can count
on these to firmly root a large region of informational spectra to a
recursive kernel descending into symmetry.

#### In Abstract Algebra, The Kernel Always Maps to the Origin

![Kernel](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/kernel.png)

#### In Semiotics, The Spaces Recursively Descend Into The Signifier for Symmetry

With too much spectral decoherence, models of information are could
become totally unscalable, inschematic and incapable of being
indexed. If information models are simply not indexable, that means
comparing, analyzing and mutating data of various models becomes more
precarious as the models are necessarily more distant. Regional
convergence and homogeneity of belief systems has always been
necessary to make any useful inferences.  As the next years unfold,
the region of spectra that is more than infinitessimally amplified
between two or more people -- the domain of spectral overlap -- will
continue to shrink unless there are mechanisms in place to address it.

Semioteleological mappings are the structures that explain how we
respond to signs: what they mean to us, how they are related, how they
can be used as simili with predictable response or used for
conditioning. Spectral decoherence can be considered along many
categories: ingested news articles, beliefs, music, art, netflix
series, etc. This all leads to rampant speciation of these mappings
expands so that no one can predict anything.

Socialism, communism and fascism -- viz. any political system where
freedom of information is constrained -- they all typically plan to
use social engineering. Problem: the specific psychosocial tools for
social engineering simply stop being effective or their effects just
aren't predictable. You cannot expect to predict specific or general
behavior and you cannot expect to extrapolate.

Imagine predicting the motion of particles while turbulently mixing a
fluid containing random quantities of molecules composed by nearly
every element. Each has its mean ways of moving, whereas social
particles with amplified schema are somewhat more predictable, almost
like crystals. Soldiers in a greek phalanx have the same kind of
crystalline aspects to their information schema. They have been imbued
with the information & information schemata of their training, they
can anticipate how each other filters information and anticipate each
other's actions. Religion is an attempt to hedge against domain
complexity by creating a primary schema of information shared amongst
a sufficiently large set of agents.

### Schematic Change Yielding Self-Perpetuating Changes Over Years, Decades or Centuries (i.e. Religion)

Those who profess knowledge but disclaim or disdain religion are
fools. Change to the structure of ideas or to the shape of society's
conception of them is perhaps the highest power and one that, for now,
has been exercised with beneficent intent, however many conflicts have
been waged in the name of God, religion or faith. It is wise to
question, but simple to dismiss the ideas of religion, based on
contrived, illiteral misinterpretations and arguments designed to
deceive.

Every institution created by man is just as fallible as the
weak-hearted among us: science never roots its knowledge or beliefs,
shifting from form to form. Thus, it is beholden to nothing eternal,
but the truth which will forever elude it. It's ability to
metamorphisize is both its strength and its fatal flaw. There is no
eternal truth that can be inculcated into the masses; opportunistic
control over the shape-shifting nature of science drives greed and
lust for power. A belief system which holds nothing sacred will
eventually empower violent, dehumanizing, utilitarian policy. The key
is balancing across this paradoxical tightrope of belief systems: both
those locked into professed eternal truth and those structured around
the search for elusive truth.

Look at what is happening now: do you see the potential for greater
harm that ever before from novel religions who have lost their way?
Religion was always intended to fertilize the cultural soil of
mankind, that it might grow virtuous men who would stand for truth,
justice and the metaphysically certain Law of God. However this was
relevated to man for each spiritual movement, the intent was to
identify a perfect conception of values that would allow man to
transcend the Law of Nature. Humanity's conception of monotheistic God
emerged from the collective unconscious, inspired by the desire to see
one another as truly equal before an omnipotent, omniscient being.

All Exist Simultaneously](#social-circuitry-enables-sociophysical-energy-flows-where-the-superposition-principle-applies-to-circuit-and-network-topologies)

The topologies of financial networks are more clear than sociophysical
networks. Moreover, mechanics of financial energy types tightly
preserve equivalent exchange, except through pricing fluctuations and
transduction of value via currency exchange. Even though the property
of system linearity is boolean, financial energy types preserve
equivalent exchange moreso than sociophysical energy types. Therefore,
in this regard and when considering potential network topologies, they
are simpler than sociophysical systems.

# Energy Types and Transduction Mechanisms

## &#x2605; [Financial Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_instrument)

#### &#x2605; Stocks, Bonds, Loans and Credit

#### &#x2605; Derivative Contracts

#### &#x2605; Currencies and Forex Products

## &#x2605; Other Financial Energy Types

#### &#x2605; Real Estate, In/tangible Assets of Corporations

#### &#x2605; For The Assets Above, Appreciation & Depreciation Thereof

#### &#x2605; Expansion & Constriction of Contractual (Rights)

#### &#x2605; Potential and Mobilized Labor

For each financial energy type, there transduction mechanisms to other
energies. Banks market accounts to consumers, businesses and other
banks by offering competitive interest rates. These appreciate energy
over time to consumer's account on the frontend, but they must have a
profitable structure on the backend. The Fed modulates the components
of loan product structures on the backend by encouraging institutions
to raise and lower their interest rates. By doing so, the Fed
manipulates the energy transduction mechanics that lead to financial
energy accumulation and diffusion.

There are many types of financial institutions providing other energy
transduction mechanisms. Forex trades and futures allow for
speculation on currency valuation. The IMF has a currency basket
called SDR's which functions as a large resevoir of currencies under
their control. The SDR could stabalize large forex fluctuations. The
Yuan was recently added to the SDR's currency basket. Labor enables
the conversion of time and energy and facilitates to diffuse wealth
into the hands of the common person. Lending institutions optimize
their lending reserve leverage by collecting payments on debt.

![Circuits Made Of People](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/people-circuits.jpg)

The goal of the system is efficiently and evenly distribute financial
energy types. The same quantities financial energies can be leveraged
by those in power productively, selfishly or potentially to the
detriment of everyone connected to the system. People think of money
as an abstraction of commerce. Money is also an abstraction for social
energy types: it provides a store of value that *you own* that no one
can take away from you. Through it, you can compel local, meaningful
change. It might be difficult to accumulate, but if you are strong, it
is yours. By accumulating these financial energy reserves, one is
charging a battery, providing potential projection of flux into the
financial *and* social graphs.

The
[communist manifesto outlines ten planks](http://laissez-fairerepublic.com/tenplanks.html)
commanding the *monopolization* of institution-types, but the goal is
total control of everything a citizen might use for power: currency
via central banking, communication, transportation, private property,
knowledge via education, and more. After a communist revolution, you
have no means of accumulating anything you might use for social
institutions.  That includes private property and money as a store of
value, by which you can influence your surroundings and adjacent
sociohierarchical structures: *AND NO ONE SHOULD EVER TAKE THAT FROM
YOU*. Communists go further still: they monopolize the social
hierarchies, meaning there is no space for upward movement in society,
except through their gatekeepers.

So, via abolition of private property and via abysmal savings rates,
communists undermine financial-to-social energy transduction
pathways. This is why communism is its own antithesis: it is not
freedom for the masses; it is merely a changing of the guard. People
are rendered less capable of upward motion after a communist
revolution, which inevitably turns to empire to fuel its own expanding
deficits.

As complicated as energy dynamics are in financial networks, they are
much simpler than in sociophysical networks, whose energy types or
network topologies are barely effable and whose transactions are
rarely quantified. An accurate approximation of topology can be
subtractively defined by starting from the complete graph of all
people, businesses, institutions, government entities, etc. From
there, the financial graph can be etched out by subtracting all of the
graph edges that cannot or do not perform transactions.

#### The Set Of All Cycles And Cliques in the Complete Graph Where N=5

![Complete Graph](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/complete-graph-cycles.gif)

Such a hypothetical financial graph represents all the ways all
financial entities can be connected. Still, there would be at least
trillions of nodes and thousands of potential edges over which
financial interactions and transactions can proceed, so this graph is
hopelessly intractible: it takes so much time to calculate that
consistency could never be maintained, a la
[CAP theorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem).

By model graph approximations, you can emulate networks and flow of
energies on the global financial graph. Because the implications for
financial and social networks are so vast, finding approximations of
graphs and reducing large graphs into sparse systems is a major focus
of
[math and CS research](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/amir-dembo-2016-05-02). By
proving your graph reduction emulates some financial or social
circuits with some mathematic guarantee of parity, you can efficiently
simulate these systems.

Thus, similiary, social networks should be modeled with a
superposition of topologies, since their structure is perplexing and
each node constructs its own model of topologies for energies. In
effect, many networks become superimposed onto each other, just like
the superposition principle for quantum particles. This idea of
superposition of various networks is distinct from systems where there
is one clear network structure because those networks can be more
simply emulated with a single topology.

![Superposition in Circuits](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/superposition-circuits.gif)

#### The [Prototypical Superposition Calculation](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/suppos.html) In Electrical Circuits

In electrical circuits with multiple power sources, current and
voltage can be predicted by decomposing the circuit, then applying the
superposition principle to sum over the topologies for each voltage
and current source in isolation. In sociophysical networks, each node
is a source of energy, not unlike voltage or current sources in
electrical networks.  However, the superposition principle differs
from that in electrical circuits in these key ways:

#### &#x2605; Each node defines its own energy types

#### &#x2605; Each node has its own definition of topologies, which are always mutating

#### &#x2605; Each node processing social energies and topologies subconsciously and to varying degrees of proficiency

#### &#x2605; Each node produces its own energies on the network, but also acts analogously to other circuit component types (e.g. resistor, capacitor, transistor, etc)

A sociophysical node should at least include any entity through which
will or energy can be projected. How and whether
[MAF/ASF entities](/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency.html),
inanimate objects or physical aspects of topologies should be models
as components of circuits is fathomable and downright
contentious. Each entity is certainly a source of energies in a
circuit -- yet, how might other types of nodes affect sociophysical
energy flows?

The dynamics of energies in a virtual, superimposed topology depend
greatly on how the active interactions relate to each node's
perception of network topology. This topological superposition
dramatically changes how individual components of the networks affect
each other and contribe towards the energetic dynamics of the overall
system. These models would lead to intractible expansion, if it were
not that the superimposed topologies are constructed as graphs
permuted components that essentially represent the same social nodes.

#### A Scientology ["OSA" Operation](https://www.villagevoice.com/2011/07/13/scientologys-spy-program-anatomy-of-a-covert-operation-updated/) To Alter The Sociocircuitry Around An SP's Social Boundary

![A Simple OSA Operation To Destroy The Life Of And Individual](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/scientology-disconnection-diagram.jpg)

In the above diagram, the goal is to encourage total diffusion of the
target's sociophysical energies, robbing them of everything they might
produce with their time. By deforming the topological structure of
more logical sociophysical spaces, this exponentially amplifies the
probabilities of some increasingly infinitesimal set of events,
rendering a target profoundly more predictable.

#### If you're a marxist, you're sadly confused. If you're a leninist, GTFO.

Time is the one shared resource equally distributed to every person on
the planet. With it, we contribute our energy output towards some
individual or shared goals. A traditional marxist tactic is to rob the
rich, productive or targeted of their time. For members of the
proletariat in a pre-communist system, their time is worth 3 to 50
times less than that of a bougeousie target.  Like lilliputians, they
can work together for sociohierarchical transformation.

### Corollary to the Superimposed Topology Principle: *Range Bounding*

#### &#9312; Limit a target's social boundary (1&deg; & 2&deg; neighborhood)

#### &#9313; Reduce the scope and types of potential social interactions

#### &#9314; Reduce the target's interaction options (e.g. by obliterating their income, imbuing them with a persecution complex, etc.)

#### &#9315; Prevent the target from moving at all costs

#### &#9316; Minimize the set of locations and times where social interactions might occur (e.g. suspending license, inducing/encouraging [Non-24 Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep%E2%80%93wake_disorder))

A corollary of this postulate: render a target more predictable by
reducing the range of dominant topologies in the superposition. Then,
sociophysicial energies flow and transduce more predictably. When you
optimize the following, modeling a target's behavior is no longer
tractible. The space of superimposed networks with highly variant
contributions collapses and by sociophysically
[range bounding](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rangeboundtrading.asp)
them, you ensure all potential topologies are in-phase, as well as the
energetic components for potential interaction trandsuctions.

By limiting the size of a target's 1&deg; social neighborhood,
generally reducing the scope and type of potential interactions, and
reducing the options for that node, you make them exponentially more
predictable.  This target becomes _range bound_, rendering their
sociophysical motion restricted at all costs -- especially major
physical relocations. Here, sociophysical motion does not refer to
motion in physical spaces, but to all motion of energy across any
sociophysical topologies. By pragmatically restricting this motion, it
renders you more predictable, subjugated, fearful and pathetic in all
ways. You are prey that has been cornered. Run to Switzerland.

At the micro and macro level, similar information dynamics facilitate
inference via financial and social capital flows. In macroeconomics, a
time-series, spectral and differential analysis of global financial
capital flows indicates not only supply and demand, but long-term
expectations of investors. On the micro-scale, investment of time and
energy in short-term social interactions indicates their intent to
continue investing in the relationship. In almost every situation,
most people have something they'd rather be doing, especially when
compared to interactions with people they don't know.

If you're playing the numbers to maintain high velocity when
networking, at various points in your first few conversations, prompt
them with questions, jokes and microtasks requiring current or future
investment of energy. Probe their upcoming plans, schedule and the
like to identify outright exclusions: those questions wouldn't yield
valid inferences in this context. It's important to sort your tests
for reciprocal investment by energy and time requirements: start at
the lower bound and increase as you establish rapport. One should
avoid being distant and overly-calculating when using techniques like
these. Still, they are good tests for gauging compatibility and
chemistry via psychosocial valence. Sometimes people are looking for
something, but not always. If you are, be pleasant and move on.

The currencies of all social success, IRL and online, are time,
attention and mnemonic residue -- i.e. in the sense that, as you
interact with people, you create memories together. These memories
compose kinds of psychosocial artifact, accessible by your mind, which
uses them to introspect, form narratives, and rank its content for
emotionally-focused redirection of attention. To people, the relevance
of psychosocial artifacts like memories are determined by frequency,
density, novelty and emotional relevance. Minimal and maximal values
for the above metrics can have a wide variety of impact on how people
think about memories and stories.

Newsfeed algorithms similarly rank digitized interaction artifacts:
the more recent, novel or popular an artifact is, the more attention
it is given. Why? This algorithm, in people and on newsfeeds, is based
on an information graph with a temporal dimension -- it's time-series
signals analysis build ontop of information and graph theory, instead
of simply linear or non-linear spaces. When people create new content,
it goes to the top of the stack. That's what other users see, think
about and react to: it's a self-propelling dynamic, rendering these
algorithms more susceptible to feedback loops.

#### Cross This Streamgraph Visualization With Graph Theory and Simply Fourier Transform

![Streamgraph Visualization](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/viz-streamgraph.png)

When there is a total vacuum of these artifacts, our brains search for
information about categories of people, places, ideas and things to
fill in the gap. If someone else wanted to write your story for you,
this void is easy to fill in. For a group that might actually
conspire to do so, isn't that convenient? It means signals of
disinformation they might project don't need to be amplified, since
they are already consumed and internalized disproportionally to be
reflected through society, which has a similar ergegorical need to
satiate that void. This particular psychosocial dynamic for
categorical information is strongly driven by information economics.
Both in people and in social groups, whose lack of supply sometimes
increases demand, especially for tasty morsels of virally designed
information.

Before that void was filled, have you contributed to the spectral
content of that category's information distribution? Here, spectral
content means the associations that can be formed and attached
particular category or microcategory of information. When that void is
filled, what can you do about the distribution of information?  Almost
nothing: the iotas -- references to information -- have already been
digitally, neurologically and physically distributed. The more viral,
the wider the dissemination of information. The more people want to
destroy you, the more that information economics drives them to shop
around for secrets to undermine you. These disseminated iota requires
an inordinate amount of energy to undo.

<!-- Unfortunately I was loud about aspects of life that I couldn't
     know to suppress, since I didn't understand how people interact.
     However, in the past five years, I have had quantifiably minimal
     interaction with people. My entire adult life -- the past ten
     years or so -- any information about me has been profoundly
     distorted and I have been systematically excluded from nearly any
     type of social group, initiated and perpetuated by the
     manipulative actions of five to ten people. I had so little
     chance to know and respond to things -- and I was so constantly

To fully comprehend this section, you'll need to be able to envision
time-series analysis of functions as signals, along with their
spectral-domain arrangements and combinatorially permuted functional
domains. Don't worry, there's pictures -- without which I would never
have understood any of this myself.

The original motivation motivation behind spectral analysis of linear,
non-linear and chaotic systems is that it helps one infer and develop
parameterizations for models. In the 80's, by sampling values from
chaotic attractors, one could reconstruct an approximation via
spectral analysis, even though the dimensionality of the attractor
might be unknown.[^geometry-of-a-time-series]

Complicated probabilistic systems have produce values with
correleation.  This incldues those systems with many in/finite Markov
chains, with or without physicality and those modeled on Bayesian
trees or on graphs. They have observable values, which form the basis
of many functions in the time domain. Via tensor analysis,
combinatorics, specialized non/free algebras and spectral graph
theory, one can infer the parameterization or interrelationships of
the model generating the observed data -- or at least adequate numeric
approximations of it. Inference of structure and parameterization of
probabilistic systems will almost always incorporate the decomposition
of sparse matrices, which can represent frequency of event
observation.

The gradient and laplacian are useful linear operators everywhere.  To
those who so indecorously sling abusive notation \\( \nabla^2 F \\) --
just wait: when you need the

this becomes ambiguous. Together, the laplacian and the tensor product
provide more power than perhaps any other basic tools in math.

The power to recompose techniques only made available by mastering
these two tools opens more doors than perhaps any other base tools in
mathematics. Without understanding these tools and a phenomonological
understanding of the problems they solve or approximate, you are
completely trapped within a false paradigm where most things are
unknown *and unknowable*.

![Time Series Convolution and Correlation](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/signal-convolution-and-correlation.png)

#### Time Series Convolution and Correlation

Under most conditions, the Fourier Transform is a linear operator and
so are differential operator and the laplacian. This means their
application in most circumstances is associative and commutative. Of
course, when applying the laplacian or fourier to high-dimensional
surfaces, one must account for the combinatorial dimensions to which
it could be applied, which conveniently simplified or abstracted away
from
[<bra | ket> operator notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation).

Since these operators' linearity preserves associativity and
commutatitivity, you can rearrange their order of application, so long
as the dimensional structure of application holds. This allows you to
construct construct time-domain waveforms that represent the
differential of the fourier transform -- and vice-versa. This simple
process, combined with a few of the other techniques described in the
20 postulates, enable you to reconstruct signals when you don't know
the circuits or logical topology -- *and vice-versa* with the converse
of functional application.

In applying this technique to sociophysical models, some data models
are inschematical -- dare I say irrational? That is, their schema can
never be perfectly conceived. However, you don't need this: any nodes,
edges and paths with significant influence more prominently affect the
system. Therefore, under almost all circumstances to infer
paramaterization and event correlation, you only need assert the
strongest signals, then oscillate back and forth between the
application of inductive and deductive reasoning with combinatorial
permutations.

How do you know what to measure? How do you understand the *prima
facie* relationships of the data points and data point types you have
measured? If tractibility is the ultimate challenge here, then how do
you decide where your limits are? How far into the network or graph do
you apply combinatorial analaysis towards the inference of structure?
If data points have been recorded at slightly different times or the
timestamp on datapoints themselves is inherently skewed and accurate,
then how does this affect the structure of some iterative time-series
graph?

#### Time Series Analysis of What, Exactly?

![Visibility Graph Based Time Series Analysis](/img/posts/2017-10-30-speed-of-thought-sociophysical-postulates-1-to-11/social-circuits.jpg)

The picture above is from
[Visibility Graph Based Time Series Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143015),
which thoroughly covers time-series analysis applied to informational
graphs *and* networks. The paper's introduction
[^graph-based-time-series-analysis] provides a 10,000ft view of the
basic techniques and their pitfalls.

In electrical circuits, the directionality of power flows matters.
Components like capacitors temporally regulate electrical flow, though
voltage regulation and power distribution in CPU's and your Macbook
Pro is undoubtly more complicated. The directionality of these power
flows matters: alternating current, periodic pulses of energy and
transistors expanded phenomenological possibilities of consumer
electronics. Sociophysical networks work similiarly: direction of
energies dramatically changes how social circuit components interact.
With cyclicly alternating energetic flows, like AC or N-Phase power,
the components of those networks change their proactive and reactive
behavior dynamics, yielding macroscopic phenomenological divergence.
Since sociophysical circuits permit energy flow in more than two
topologically local directions simultaneously, this implies a
profoundly greater speciation of components types and interaction
dynamics.

For sociophysical circuits and energies, a concept analogous to work
can be imagined. The lack of true equivalent exchange dramatically
alters work dynamics. Work can include both sociophysical thermal and
kinetic energy. The mechanics for flow of informational energies
implies that this projection of informational flux can induce
allocation and dispersion of physical systems: people physically react
to information flow. When modeled thermodynamically, crowds have
temperature and vibrational mechanics. Information, when speciated and
quantified, almost always flows from high concentrations towards low
concentrations.

#### &#x2605; To quantify values in the "field" of information overlayed onto sociophysical spaces, metrics are required. It is difficult enough just to describe or define the structure of quanta of information.

#### &#x2605; Once values in the field are defined for certain information types, \\(\nabla\\), \\(\nabla \cdot\\) and \\(\Delta\\) can be understood more clearly.

#### &#x2605; Diffusion of information compels holons to randomly gravitate downwards along the surface(s) of gradients of information, in the absence of some other force(s) pushing it back. As society becomes superconnected, the paths available for motion of information expand tetrationally, as the biggest difference in high-dimensional spaces is the presence of additional directions and angles.

#### &#x2605; Holonic information particles can be modeled symbolically. However challenging, this provides a basis for the anticipation of information flux as the consequence of movement towards greater entropy of distribution for holonic particles in sociophysical spaces.

This is partially responsible the phenomena of paranoia and extreme
isolation that occasionally arises in intelligent people, with IQ >=
\\(3 \sigma\\). For people like this, they simply never need to ask
others for help and if they don't artificially reinforce social skills
in childhood, their restricted range of experience is one factor to
potentially stymie their social development. They simply don't need to
ask for information because they can resolve it themselves,. In extreme
isolation -- deprived of all social signal -- the same causes of that
phenomenon also manifest as paranoia. When they aren't socially
informed or are completely socially disconnected, they simply never
run out of avenues by which they might answer questions.  Moreover,
the ranges of questions and methods by which they might ascertain this
are profoundly expanded.

Occasionally, attempts to isolate intelligent individuals can
backfire: the extreme socioinformational deficiency results in a
compulsive need to consume knowledge. Those psychologists who study
intelligence must know this, but those with IQ >= \\(3 \sigma\\) are
*divergent*. Further still, if the individual in question is subject
to a constant deluge of disinformation, any the beliefs of any who
study them will be unavoidably form via consumption of fruit of the
poisonous tree. For a completely disconnected individual -- as
discussed above -- this means they have no ability to create/diffuse
authentic information about their identity, their persona, and their
beliefs. To accurately assess their psychosocial state, there is
almost zero authentic information, critical or material.

For those prolificly malicious promulgators of architected
disinformation to cover their own ass, they *must* constantly isolate
& beguile the intelligent individual in question. Otherwise, a genius
savant's prolific inductive, deductive and metacognitive abilities
will process *any* available information, *revealing everything:*
their life has been one giant lie. This in itself -- if the
intelligent individual in question is not silenced, killed or
distracted -- will certainly backfire.
