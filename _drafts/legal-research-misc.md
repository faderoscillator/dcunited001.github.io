# Arbitration

### Misc Questions

- when does arbitration begin? when is the individual notified?
- how do you know how to compel an arbitration dispute?
- how do organizations like AAA & JAMS handle various specifications
  of arbitration in different contracts?
  - a corporation that has experienced arbitration for specific types
    of cases has an advantage in choosing the arbitor
  - the corporation also has the advantage in structuring it

### [Federal Arbitration Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Arbitration_Act)


### In Consumer Finance

- [CPFB rule on arbitration](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/07/19/2017-14225/arbitration-agreements)

- what are these arbitration agreements usually structured?
  specifically for consumer finance?
  - none of the news articles cover any specifics at all
    - neither does the Treasury Department's publication, which itself
      was trying to undermine the credibility of the CFPB's own study
      - i haven't read that yet, but assume that both are likely
        arguing for their own agenda
      - i'm not sure a single rule to dis/allow any arbitration
        whatsoever is a good idea when "consumer finance" itself isn't
        well defined.
      - however, forcing arbitration contracts to hold puts a
        disproportionate amount of control into the hands of groups w/
        money & power to structure these agreements
  - [Mandatory Arbitration in Consumer Finance and Investor Contracts](http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2660&context=articles)
    - this study delves into more details on the specifics of
      arbitration agreements, as applied to consumer finance &
      investor contracts

#### Private Organizations include [AAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Arbitration_Association) and [JAMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMS_(organization))

- [AAA Consumer Arbitration Fact Sheet](http://info.adr.org/consumer-arbitration/)
- [AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf)

#### [AT&T Mobility v. Conceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Mobility_LLC_v._Concepcion)

- here AT&T claimed that the Conceptions could not file class-action
  lawsuits because each individual case was obligated to resolve
  disputes via arbiration first
  - district/appelate cases argued whether California law assumed
    precedence over the FAA

### International Arbitration, specified in ISDS clauses

- this process seems very complicated.
- [ICSID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Centre_for_Settlement_of_Investment_Disputes)
  is kind of an equivalent to AAA/JAMS
  - how does ICSID choose arbitrators? where are the court cases held?
  - however, since it involves disputes amoung nations & other
    international parties where the decisions could result in
    political/economic consequences, then these have to proceed in a
    very different manner
- after all the interest in the ISDS case b/w US & Iran, i found some
  documents on this, but i don't actually have all the time in the
  world.

# Contract Law

### Unconscionability

- [Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc.]()
  - CA Supreme Court Case that determined the basis/tests for a
    contract to be voided via unconscionability
  - need more details here. not sure how this applies to federal law
