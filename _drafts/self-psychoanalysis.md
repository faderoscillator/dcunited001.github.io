email to family (12/)

I apologize ahead of time for some of this being angrily worded or
whatever, but I am not saying anything to cast blame. Only to address
the actual causes of problems, so they can no longer be problems. Most
of this is the fault of about 5 or 6 people in my life who took
advantage of my social vulnerability to turn otherwise neutral people
into people who were negative.

Several things stand out as frustrating:
- the maximal level of social isolation (mostly caused by lack of
  income)
- the minimal level of awareness that anyone has of my life
- the minimal level of acknowledgement that i receive from my closest
  social connections (as it relates to writing, math, startups,
  especially SOCIAL PHYSICS or any actual goals i have in life)
- the acceptance and minimal lack of acknowledgement of
  catastrophically minimized sociophysical metrics.
- the minimal degree by which anyone who knows me or recently met me
  would try to reach out and invite me into their life, instead of
  keeping things as purely awkward acquaintanceship.
- the totally zero'd demographics for social connections/interactions
  that help me advance toward goals (by demographics i mean:
  - number of math professors I talk to (regularly)
  - number programmers i talk to and frequency of interaction
  - number of dancers i talk to
  - number of musicians/etc (ANY ONE OF THE MANY MANY
    HOBBIES/INTERESTS I HAVE -- NONE OF THEM, NOT A SINGLE ONE, IS
    EVER FULFILLED -- there's no one to see it and thus no one cares.)
  - number of generally interesting people to talk to. not everyone
    needs to be a musician. I can actually talk about anything

I am absolutely not saying that I'm disregarding the people I talk to
at the rink -- even though the number of connections/interactions
there is still low. what i'm complaining about is that I have ZERO
interactions with people who can reciprocate with goals/hobbies. There
is NONE. ZERO. IT IS MATH.

"There's no one to see it and thus no one cares." this statement in
particular really sums of the situation. Or: "If a tree fell in a
forest and no one was around to talk to it, would anyone care?" It's
not that people hate me, it's that I'm completely isolated from
everyone else, with zero options for improving the situation, except
accepting subpar mediocrity, if you can call it that.

=========

* Adrafinil: almost exactly an ADD prescription drug (the liver
  converts it into the exact pharmaceutical called Modafinil or
  Provigil)

Adrafinil is fairly effective. It helps in an indirect way, but the
actual drug Modafinil is hard to get from a doctor because only
Psychiatrists can prescribe it off-label (it's officially for
narcolepsy and offsetting shift-work)

=========


* Noopept: is something I just tried for the first time. It is similar
  to Racetams which are the most well-known smart-drug. I had never
  tried them because I assumed they would be weak. Noopept is
  chemically unrelated, but acts in the same way. I wish I had tried
  any of the racetams a year ago.

However, for me, Noopept is a miracle drug. Every neurological social
problem I have had is almost completely gone, or at least it's in the
background. It also seems to help with queuing behaviors/responses in
social/personal situations (i.e. my executive functioning) Wherefore
the complications are thus explained below, NooPept seems to eliminate
the problems that I have with social vulnerability:

- poverty of speech
- slow speed of thought
- lack of subconscious processing of social signal
- overly high level of engagement/effort required to socially
  reciprocate
- rigidly limited variety of grammatical structures in my responses
  (this is something I can mathematically define and I am/was very
  weak here)
- ability to respond to not-so-subtle intimations and false/invalid
  information about me in the social frame/context (this causes me
  lots of problems)

=========

What people don't understand is that I pick up what people lay down,
yet it's been hard for me to respond. The only drug that I have ever
found to be slightly effective in addressing the above list of
problems (among others) is adderal and a handful of other illicit
drugs. This was the only reason I ever tried or continued using
them. They just weren't very effective and yet, while the
drawbacks/costs of these drugs vastly outweighed any benefit they
offered, by using some of these substances, I was able to get outside
of my overly-inhibited mind. Life and social situations were slightly
different. However, the stigma of these drugs present some of the most
harmful effects. Nothing slams more doors in your face than rumors
about substances. Well, I wanted to feel what it might be like to be
normal, socially.

The main problem: i've been in near-total isolation without sufficient
variety of social experience to layer down the social conditioning
which leads to adult development. Everyone wants to call me an "adult
child" but no one wants to look at why this every occured or address
the root problems. I do not care "whose fault" anything is. If I point
something out, it is because I want to make it better or FIX IT.

I started taking some supplements last Wednesday and the second one
(Noopept) eliminates almost all of the seemingly "neurological"
problems I have been dealing with. I say neurological because it seems
like half my brain is off, mostly seeming to effect low-level
neurological functions pertaining to interpersonal communication,
social dynamics, etc. Over the past few years, my mind has felt like
an old CPU trying to run graphics-intensive code, without a graphics
processor. (if that sounds complicated, you should probably keep
reading anyways: i explain & the important stuff is emphasized)

Social dynamics are mostly unconscious for other people. That is, for
everyone else, the subconscious mind does a ton of work and presents
options to the conscious mind, which selects and engages. For me, that
subconscious aspect of social processing has been completely missing,
which is why I almost never say anything in social situations or get
frustrated and leave. That "graphics processing" behavior that seems
so simple for other people is completely missing for me, which means
my conscious mind has to walk through every social situation. THIS IS
SLOWWWWWW, which is why everything thinks I'm dumb or awkward. JUST
LIKE MY MEMORY ISSUES: THIS IS NEUROLOGICAL. There is nearly nothing I
can do about it, which is what makes NooPept a miracle for me: because
it is the only drug I have ever taken in my life which improves the
social issues in any significant capacity.

Also, when I say something is neurological, it descends from
ASPERGER'S, a diagnosis for which no doctor will accurately label me,
even though the neurologist who examined my MRI's SAID I HAD PDD-NOS
(sometime in 5th grade, 1995, at a neurologist office on McLelland (?)
and an imaging facility on Franklin Rd) And what is PDD-NOS? Pervasive
Developmental Disorder (Not Otherwise Specified) => It is a former
diagnosis on the autism spectrum, often related to head injuries. The
most recent version of the DSM lumps all the Autism Spectrum
development disorders into one. However, not being able to lean on
this crutch in any official way means that I don't have a legal leg to
stand on. Normally, someone with Asperger's or with high-functioning
autism can compensate for social issues by having a REAL job, with
enough income to trade financial capital for social capital. However,
i seem to be witch-hunted everywhere I go.

The problem here is that => Since, the basis for the problems causing
problems is neurological, I cannot control some things indirectly
causing so many other problems in my life. Since I have overleveraged
my family's support, those few family connections are BURNT OUT, which
is just what happens. I did not realize the severity of how social
isolation limited my life until recently, but the effect of extreme
isolation on someone's life is MULTIPLICATIVE/EXPONENTIAL. So, the
consequences contribute towards OPPOSITE of any goals that a real
psychologist/psychiatrist would pursue. Most people who i've seen or
been treated by in an official capacity recognize this and see it.
Here are some examples of the normally positive goals/functions/habits
that are defeated by people who seem to intervene in my life with an
agenda.

- totally undermining the Maslovian Hierarchy of Needs, every time I
  manage to get it together and move out.
- preventing me from being exposed to new ideas (which can include
  habits that lead to a more efficient life:
  - having/using a dresser,
  - having/using a closet (for clothes or for towels, which would
    encourage daily shaving),
  - having/using a piece of furnature for organizing bathroom
    toiletries
  - having
  - many of these are simply habits that are learned upon exposure,
    when living with other people.
  - many of the above are sooo obvious that no self-respecting
    psychologist could avoid commenting on what this does to an adult
    child: it's like putting all the healthy routines on a high-shelf
    outside of their reach. COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPISTS WOULD WANT
    TO REDUCE BARRIERS AND INEFFICIENCY
   - but they just don't know BECAUSE OF SOCIAL ISOLATION
   - there is simply AS CLOSE TO ZERO PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE WHO WOULD
     EVER INGEST INFORMATION RELATED TO
- total minimization of GENERALLY ANY & ALL INFORMATION leaking out
  from my social network
  - the goal: there is minimal information to clean up afterwards
  - with zero meaningful social interactions
  - however, social signal is almost always TWO WAY
    - therefore, NO SIGNAL OUT, NO SIGNAL IN
    - SO HOW T.F. COULD ANYONE EXPECT ME TO DEVELOP AND PROGRESS OUT
      OF ADULT CHILDHOOD: MY SITUATION ALWAYS INSTEAD
      PROVOKES/ENCOURAGES/REGRESSES MY SITUATIONS
    - and never, EVER, EVER has my situation ever took into account my
      ACTUAL complexes & diagnoses.
      - e.g. no acknowledgement of the neurological nature of problems
        or asperger's diagnosis
      - e.g. no acknowledgement of TOTAL SOCIAL ISOLATION
      - e.g. no acknowledgement of character assassination and career
        assassination NONE
      - e.g. no acknowledgement of lack of exposure to ANY AND ALL
        basic hygienic and adult daily self-care behaviors.
      - e.g. no acknowledgement of what it takes for someone to
        PROGRESS who has: asperger's, an attachment disorder, tons of
        virally defamatory information, BOTH a superiority complex and
        an inferiority complex.
- social isolation & deconstruction of a support network
  - exhaustion/burnout of the few strong 1° connections remaining
  - minimization of experiences with 2° interactions (or by framing
    those interactions in/with negative information)
  - "poisoning the contextual frame" by which people I meet or have
    just met will view me, so that they generally avoid me, which
    constricts the size and demographics of my 1° social neighborhood
  - these generally undermine the development of any support
    network. AND SURPRISE! I have no interpersonal outlet for stress,
    except social media. ISN'T THAT OBJECTIVELY CONTRARY TO SOME
    PEOPLE'S STATED GOALS? gaslighting + social-isolation + induction
    of stress
- minimization positive public attention, exaggeration of negative
  public attention
- the reduction of frequency and demographic spectral range of
  novel/repeated social interactions. this prevents information from
  leaking out....

Basically, i'm saying that there is ZERO possible chance for my state
to have improved over the past few years. I am not saying that the
psychologists who i've seen have failed. I'm moreso worried about
IATROGENIC TREATMENT, even when it happens to be done with good
intentions.

Social Neighborhood - The number of people within n° social
connections of you. Your 1° social neighborhood is all the people
you're directly connected to. Your 2° social neighborhood is all your
friends of friends. However, what is the size of my 1° social
neighborhood, if you consider connections to be someone I directly
interact with for more than 15 minutes or an hour per week. IT IS ONE
PERSON: MY MOM, WITH WHOM I SHARE A TOXIC RELATIONSHIP, THE FAULT FOR
WHICH LIES ON BOTH SIDES, PERHAPS MORESO MINE. But the point is that
there is one person through which all of my social interactions are
lensed, outside of social media, which everyone stays away from. I do
not care what the cause of this is or who's fault it is. It doesn't
matter, except to discern the best way to FIX THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.

If you want to know what I'm up against, here are about ten complexes
I have MOST OF WHICH WERE UNNECESSARILY ACQUIRED (INTENTIONALLY
ENCOURAGED & CERTAINLY NEVER DISCOURAGED)

(1) superiority complex (2) inferiority complex (3) attachment
disorder (4) PTSD (5) persecution complex (6) asperger's AND (7)
social isolation where any shred of financial independence is
undermined by sociopathic workplace bullies

... there's a few more i don't feel like typing out right now.
However, very little has EVER been done in my life addresses any of
the above seven. AND I DON'T HAVE "LETTERS" BEHIND MY NAME.... . . . .

That said, the therapists i've seen aren't bad: they all
listened. There are several factors that prevented adequate treatment.

- e.g. I moved a lot. Whenever I live in Roanoke, I'm living in
  poverty (less than $8,000 in disposable income since September 2014
  => THREE YEARS)
  - so i can't pursue the kinds of social interactions that will help
    me PROGRESS
  - AND NO, IT"S NOT SOMETHING THAT WORKING AT BEST BUY WILL FIX =>
    HELP ME FIX MY GODDAMN CAREER IF YOU GIVE A SHIT
- e.g. I couldn't talk about how minimized sociophysical metrics
  affected my life if i didn't recognize them.
- e.g. as long as i'm socially isolated & socially mitigated, no one
  else saw the obvious things in my life that I couldn't see
  either. (i've been isolated by many factors, some of them are in my
  control -- IT'S KIND OF A PERFECT STORM THOUGH)

... and the thing about perfect storms? They are the confluence of
many factors, each of which has a low or even infinitesimal
probability yet together, they can't be explained by statistics --
unless you take into account intentional and unintentional
actions/consequences of the FEW people who interact with me. That's
where the isolation backfires.

Why am I so frustrated? I have been psychologically TORTURED: my human
rights have been violated at work, in my social life and in my private
life. People I worked with at Jumpcloud (to a much smaller extent)
also obtained false and damaging information about me, which is
seemingly available to anyone and everyone. They used the same tactics
as others: (1) identifying some set of symbols to use as an ad-hoc
subconscious test (2) hit me with the symbolic stimulus when I'm not
expecting it (3) judging my reaction against information they had
obtained from some other source
(rumors/doxxing/intel/surveillance/email/social/... and WHO TF KNOWS)
...

I call this "rorschaching" => presenting me with symbol to judge my
subconscious reaction as an indication of my thoughts/beliefs. The
problem? The people that are using these ad-hoc verbal tests to judge
me or label me have been getting it wrong the whole time. Because of
my social vulnerability & ineptitude, I have never projected enough
SOCIAL SIGNAL into situations to define/sculpt/shape my own
identity. Instead, someone obtains DEFAMATORY information about me
(from who knows where) and -- IN THE TOTAL VACUUM OF ANY SOCIAL SIGNAL
FROM ME (since I don't know how) -- THAT HIGHLY TOXIC PERSON AT WORK
(THAT ONE GUY) indirectly undermines my character and gradually
isolates me at work by targeting any +1° coworkers who support me or
have positive relationships with me. My social vulnerability (WHICH IS
NEUROLOGICAL) leaves me alone, all the while society seems to want to
destroy anything and everyone I touch --

-- and yeh, things have gotten much better => people in the past two
years have acted much nicer and positive towards me than I would
expect. No one treats me poorly at the skating rink.  There are only
about a half/dozen people with extremely negative intent towards me
over the past ten or so years -- every other person's perception of me
has been warped by these people's actions/games/etc and my own
reaction to them. However, the combined and/or indirect effects
stemming from dozen or so people could probably outweigh the combined
goodwill of a million strangers. No matter what good people try to do
in my life, it is apparently the intent and M.O. (modus operandi) of
these toxic people that the inconvenient facts of my life remain
suppressed forever. Worse, it is apparently their divine prerogative
to ensure it happens.

In 2015, 2016 and 2017, I was led astray by people who were
GASLIGHTING me, using PRIVATE INFORMATION THEY COULD HAVE ONLY
OBTAINED VIA SURVEILLANCE... Ever since approx February 27th, 2015 --
when I "remembered" everything about Tatiana Maslany -- people would
approach me and reference pieces of information (almost like
passwords/keys) to trigger specific responses. These pieces of
information could only have been obtained through surveillance or via
extensive psychological profiling -- potenw/ social media info, though
some of the information these people referenced came from various
types of signal. What is the goal of gaslighting? To drive paranoia,
to isolate, to contain, to confuse and to STIMULATE/PROVOKE MENTAL
ILLNESS.

It's not simply paranoia. There are people who approach me, gain my
trust by referring to specific symbols, luring me in with the promise
of information -- and then after briefly cultivating a rapport, they
invariably lead me into a trap. I've simply stopped trusting people
like this, but it took awhile -- and since I'm socially isolated =>
THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AROUND TO NOTICE HOW THESE PEOPLE
INTERACT. They exploit slight of mouth, covert NLP (Neuro Linguistic
Programming), covert hypnosis, obfuscating traces of communication
over multiple channels, exploiting/selecting the specific audience to
whom they project social signal.

But most of all: THEY EXPLOITED MY SOCIAL VULNERABILITY: (1) MY
NEUROLOGICAL INABILITY TO PROCESS/RESPOND AND (2) MY NEUROLOGICAL
VULNERABILITY TO HYPNOSIS (3) et cetera, without conscience, opting
instead for pragmatic, utilitarian exploitation of my psychology --
ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON MY PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE
-- without caring about what the medium-term effects would be. In
other words, these people exploited intricate knowledge of
psychology/sociology, along with ILLICITLY OBTAINED INFORMATION and
apparently the time/energy to psychologically profile me. And their
goal? To trigger a mental breakdown, to generally do everything
counter to what would benefit my psychological state and to leave me
alone & vulnerable & isolated & emotionally agitated. I have broken
nearly all of their pattern languages and after disengaging from the
toxic people, I have stabalized over the past year (ever since I left
the colab).

It really doesn't matter whether the gaslighting stuff is true, where
the information is coming from, whatever, etc, etc. I do not seem to
be the only person affected by these kinds of malicious social
behaviors.  It doesn't matter because I can sniff it out when it
happens and I can handle it BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO APPLY SOCIAL PHYSICS
AND GAME THEORY

==========

And one more thing to add to the list at the top:
- If I improve, there is no acknowledgement from my 1° social
  neighborhood.

This implies there is no positive reinforcement because there is
simply no acknowledgement. there simply aren't enough people who spend
time with me who can say ANYTHING about my psychology or my progress

Please read this post that I wrote on Social Physics. It begins to
explain how I now see social interactions on small and large
scales. Also, in this draft, there is outlined a discussion on how to
maliciously limit sociophysical aspects/metrics in someone's life to
tactically isolate them. So, I'm not making this up, I can rigorously
explain how to do it to someone else. Whether it happened to me is
debatable, but whether this can be done to someone is certain.

"Zero In Social Physics" (from the draft Speed of Thought part 3)

- Decision Model Inference & Manipulation
  - Inferences from Modes of Transportation
  - Inferences from Logical Understanding of Location
  - Inferences from Disposable Income
- Using Social Physics to Contain/Promote People & Ideas
- Muting a Target's Identity
- Isolation of Social Graph Boundaries
- Use of Fear/Love to Contract/Expand a Target's Social Boundaries
- Don't Become Big Enough to Be A Target, Work Indirectly and Disdain Ego
- Limiting/Providing Financial/Social Capital/Options
- When targets are muted and/or isolated, adversaries have major
  advantages in amplifying information (to establish it as a baseline)

### Disrupting Positive/Negative Reinforcement (Gradient Descent)

- however, constant failure with persistently null indication &
  opportunity for success causes people to become out of touch because
  their values system cannot function
  - so, there may be positive reinforcement from their social
    connections, but it is ALMOST NEVER coupled to anything meaningful
  - and there is plenty of negative reinforcement, which may or may
    not be consistently coupled to anything meaningful
    - regardless, here, negative reinforcement does not serve as a
      means for orienting oneself because the abject lack of positive
      reinforcement blinds you to any dimensions/signals that provide
      a basis for GRADIENT DESCENT
      - i suppose a similar thing happens with an abject lack of
        negative reinforcement (too much fame/success/money)
    - it just doesn't matter: you have no compass for navigating life
      experiences. after a prolonged period of this, there is total
      breakdown of your ability to recognize/emulate PATTERNS of
      positive & rewarded behavior.
      - before this happens, your habits/routines begin to
        break down. if you have money, you can easily adapt.
  - no one EVER naturally experiences this prolonged, abject
    degeneration, if we can help it. we all have our own definitions
    of positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement and success.
    - we naturally gravitate towards what feels good and move away
      from what feels bad. the strongly conscious imposition of morals
      or values systems onto one's rules for behaviors cause us to
      redefine what feels good, which is one of the most healthy
      things we can do.
    - however, if we can help it -- IF WE CAN EVER JUST MOVE THE FUCK
      AWAY FROM PAIN -- then no one stays around this abject degrading
      degeneration for long.
      - but if you can't, it means you're strapped down by something.
  - it is quite possible to DO this to someone. to lock them away in a
    sociophysical jail with a reality distortion field that completely
    distorts social signal to constantly disrupt their mind's GRADIENT
    DESCENT algorithm that informs them of what IS good, what FEELS
    good, what is bad, etc.

explain defacement of my sister's art and rationale behind it


- assuming you borrow a car, this necessarily injects a dependency on
  communication and scheduling with whoever you're going to borrow the
  car from.
          - this basically pegs every transportation need you have
            with O(n) additional tasks by injecting the equivalent of
            an unnecessary abstraction into your personal logistics.
          - if you:
            - (1) inherently weak with communication via aspergers and
              social isolation
            - (2) over several years of have accumulated a bad
              relationship with the person whose car you're borrowing,
              who is absolutely not responsible for your situation,

              (practically the *only* social connection you have in
              your hollowed out 1º social neighborhood)
            - (3) need social interaction to improve your life, but
              can't leave the house during the day because but
              can't network with the right people where you live
            - (5) you have made less than $7000 of disposable income
              since september 2014
          - then: you should read what i write because social physics
            is the answer to understanding all your problems.

# main theme:

### my strongest social connections are the most toxic

my problems are socially imposed
- the statement "you are a mixture of the 5 people you spend the most
  time with" could not be more relevant to my situation
  - except, for me, there is only one person with whom i actually
    spend a lot of time with

- the assertion that my problems are socially imposed could not be
  more true and the only way to fix my problems are by changing my
  social settings.
  - that is it. it's simple. without change to my social settings and
    social experiences, ONE CANNOT REASONABLY EXPECT FOR MY PROBLEMS
    TO CHANGE.
    - this is the sad truth, considering I basically have no where
      else to turn for help besides my family, who is the source of
      toxicity in my life.
    - they are basically drawing me in to keep me close to ensure that
      my situation never truly changes. why? to save face and that's
      it. it is solely to retroactively justify all of the other
      mistreatment in my life!

### truly random information/behavior is distinct

truly random information/behavior is distinct from tightly-coupled,
functionally relevant information/behavior.

- it is trivial to determine if someone's behavior/reactions/tactics/objectives
  are tightly-coupled to one's own. (behavior/reactions/tactics/objectives)

- a perfect storm is a random occurance ... IN NATURE! A perfect storm
  in mental health treatment IS NOT A RANDOM OCCURANCE. There is
  simply too much human involvement from so many angles.
  - One must assume it cannot be chance.

###

- similarity to solving sudoku puzzles: have to evaluate paths without
  being sure of the coherence of their truth values
  - i.e. there are no simple tactics where one can be sure that one
    move advances the solution
- similarity to the Bell distribution
  - also Hardy distribution
  - refer to the Simon Institute lectures
- liar's paradoxes, etc.

### true change springs from the intention of change

true, long-term, positive change will be the result of positive
intention in the hearts of those around me.
- if i am surrounded by people who harbor negativity in their hearts,
  my situation will not change

# No Talk of My Personal Goals. That subject IS TABOO.

- there is no talk of how to change my situation. THERE IS SIMPLY NO
  *REAL* DISCUSSION OF GOALS, PLANS, IDEAS, OR *ANYTHING* that will
  result in real, positive, long-term change!
  - there's no discussion of it. the lack of discussion is an
    indication that no one around me harbors positive intent for my
    life in their hearts.
    - you don't hear discussion related to the expression of a desire
      for real change because the desire for real, positive change
      *SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST!*
  - this is why my mom, my brother, his family, my sister, her family
    simply do not talk about my goals: *because there is no thought
    arising from the intent to support my goals!* Again, it simply
    does not exist.

I have [?] main goals in my life and these subjects just so happen to
be TABOO at the dinner-table. As in: it is strictly VERBOTEN to
discuss any of my life goals, espcially in front of our younger, more
impressionable family members, WHO ARE NEVER TO LOOK UP TO ME. **GOD,
NO!** *BECAUSE MY FATE HAS ALREADY BEEN DECIDED!!*

#### &#x2605; Become as intelligent as I can. Learn as much as I can.

- via coursera, college, whatever

#### &#x2605; Learn skills that increase my employability, life experience and personal utility

- if my employability was a concern, my family would seek to act in
  ways that sets employability as a goal
  - they don't. my mom actively acts to subversively prevent me from
    becoming more employable
  - my brother doesn't enable me with opportunities for expanding my
    skillset. for example, he wouldn't let me work on a digital
    signage solution for the skating rink.
    - I SIMPLY WAS NOT ALLOWED! NOT ALOUD!
    - Again, this would be a project that every person who worked at
      the skate center would understand I completed. And every
      customer would use.
    - a cheap, raspberry-pi digital signage solution would demonstrate
      my skills and MAKE ME MORE EMPLOYABLE.
      - however, it is their goal to prevent me from achieving my
        goals
      - AGAIN, IT IS THEIR GOAL TO ACTIVELY, BUT SUBVERSIVELY PREVENT
        ME FROM ACHIEVING MY OWN GOALS!!
        - they absolutely don't want to get caught doing so -- because
          dear God that would be disgusting wouldn't it?
        - active, subversive sabotage from one's own family?!
          - that is unthinkable


  - when I take classes on coursera or when I'm working on
    a project,

#### &#x2605; Launch a Startup or App to become an Angel Investor

- never engouraged. always discouraged.
- when I talk about a startup or busines

#### &#x2605; Become the best programmer that I could be

- again, like my other goals and strategies to attain them, it's never
  encouraged & always discouraged.
  - no discussion about my skillset and no discussion about
    previous/current projects
  - they never encouraged me to involve my nieces or nephews in a
    project.
    - even though I have boundless experience which would be
      invaluable to share.

#### &#X2605; Develop 3D Visual & Audiovisual Art after developing 3D Rendering Engine skills

- no recognition of why this would be an important goal to work
  towards.
- again, never encouraged & always discouraged.
- never discussed with extended family members. never discussed with
  friends. they NEVER seek to understand what I'm working on
  - BUT THEY ARE SO QUICK TO DISCOURAGE ME FROM WORKING ON IT
  - without ever realistically considering the profitability in
    finances, skill or experience in such projects.

#### &#x2605; Write as much as I possibly can until I have nothing left to write (i have a decade's worth of material)

- i have about 50,000 words of content that is in draft form in my
  sources branch.
  - not just onlined, but mostly completed and ready to publish
- i have another 100k words of content that is in outline form in my
  sources branch.
- i have about 300k words of content in my
- i have about 300k words of fiction content in pre-outline form

to write in my drafts folder
  on the sources


#### &#x2605; Work with an editor to monetize my writing by publishing books

- i have at least two non-fiction books I could write AND SELL

#### &#x2605; Learn Japanese (and other languages, but JP first)



#### &#x2605; Live in Japan (eventually)


### These are all realistic goals. Each and every one of them.

If i were to fail with one of them, I could exceed at another.


#### &#x2605; Stake my claim on immortality in the pages of history as a 21st Century Einstein.

Maybe this particular goal seems unrealistic. However, I can cite so
much evidence that would imply that I AM A 21ST CENTURY EINSTEIN. Yeh,
I'm about to make that argument.

Yet, I'm losing my claim to evidence supporting such a dramatic
conclusion: and this is what my family is threatening to ruin. They
are not just ruining my life. They are not just exacerbating my
personal prognosis.  They are preventing me from staking that claim:
that I am a 21st century Einstein.

How are they doing so? By disrupting my work and preventing me from
publishing information in a timely fashion.  Publishing such
information would allow me to stake my claim to high-level
developments, such as:

#### &#x2605: A Unified model for metanomics, based on probabilistic programming

EINSTEIN! Right here, in and of itself. This single theory implies
21st Century Einstein. And my family? They don't want to help me. They
want to prevent me from accomplishing this. And staking my claim to
such academic developments in a timely fashion.

All I have to do is publish the "Metanomics" series, which outlined
and partially drafted.

#### &#x2605: Ephemeral Theory of Linguistic Evolution during Ice Age, emphasizing self-organizing adherence to collective un/consciousness

In its current form, this idea is an interesting concept for a
fantasy/sci-fi series, at most. I haven't even personally verified
that this theory is distinguished from other theories of post-LGM
linguistic development. However, it should be trivial to develop
further and is at least an interesting theory.

Regardless, even presenting a summerization of this theory requires an
understanding of linguistics, anthropology, pre-history, sociology
and...


# Realistic Goals for Getting Myself Out of this situation

# How else can i tell that my family does not have good intentions

I am at the shit end of set of very emotionally abusive relationships
with my family. The strongest social & emotional relationships I have
are toxic, corrosive, and detrimental to my mental health. They
exacerbate my emotional pain. They demonstrate willful, knowledgable
adherence to "treatment plan" or a set of correlated behaviors which
could only make someone with my diagnoses worse!!

That's what is so frustrating: not only do the people closest to me
act to ignore my pain and my PTSD/Asperger's, they are acting in a way
that implies that they are willfully and knowledgably complicit in
adhering to tactics which could only make my prognosis worse. The only
reason mental health practicioners would advise my family to act in
such a way is to exacerbate underlying causes related to my
diagnosis!! So, if they are working with someone else, that someone
else is very aware of my true diagnoses and has methodically relayed
information to my family TO EXACERBATE THESE PROBLEMS! TO MAKE MY
SITUATION WORSE AND USE MY FAMILY TO DO EXACTLY THAT.


#### &#x2605; Lack of encouragement/discussion related to my goals

#### &#x2605; Antithetical Disposition towards my goals and people who support me

#### &#x2605; Not allowed to be a Role Model

#### &#x2605; Active Interference with Mental Health

- when I establish a relationship with a mental health practicioner

#### &#x2605; General Suppression of Communication

#### &#x2605; No Discussion of Problems

#### &#x2605; No Written Discussion of Problems

they haven't expended any time/energy on coming up with a plan for
getting me out of the house.  other than hoping that general
antipathy, guilt and shame will eventually make me hit "ROCK BOTTOM"
and that I might be motivated through sufficient
pain/fear/discomfort...
- what a loving family, amirite?

#### &#x2605; Duplicity of intent/action

- there are plenty of examples of where duplicity of intent/action
  behind my family's actions leads me to a more negative, more
  compromised disposition.
  - they will use duplicity of statements/actions to further restrict
    my available actions, but they never afford the same foresight,
    tactfulness when the outcome could be more positive for me
  - examples of how duplicity and tact can be used for positive
    results?

#### &#x2605; They Pursue Action with Detrimental Consequences Without Discussing It With Me

- my mom and family sought action in the court system to get the state to put
  me away. my mom went so far as to say she'd been sworn in to the
  court system.
  - she did so without warning me (not a good sign)



#### &#x2605; Feigning Incompetence

-


#### &#x2605; Inaction when I complain about being bullied at work



#### &#x2605; Feigning Ignorance, Generally

generally, when a family member and I argue, if I talk about my
writing, they act like they don't understand
- they don't want to understand because it confers rhetorical
  ammunition. it gives me reasons to legitimize my work, my writing,
  my position in the world.
  - if they conveyed understanding of my writing, they would have to
    admit that I'm practically an einstein and that they've been
    complicit in the psychological torture of this person.
  - so they feign ignorance of the content
    - and at the same time, they GUILT me for EXPECTING that they have
      either read or would understand
    - total BS Barney Fife Bullshit: "Well Golley David, I guess we
      just aren't fancy intellectuals like you"
    - when they never seek to understand in the first place
    - they do so and they emphasize that I should feel guilty for
      asking them to read and to understand!! WHAT THE FUCK?!

- yet they seek no action to acquire understanding
  - that is, they don't try to understand any of the content
    themselves
    - 40% of which any college educated person should understand


- why don't they try to understand? because their actions are
  motivated by attempts to

#### &#x2605; Feigning Ignorance when it comes to mental health policy/action

- my mom actively injects herself into psychiatric relationships when
  it
  - she does so without notifying me: she got comfortable with access
    to patient info and capacity to manipulate the relationship with
    Dr. Mylan

#### &#x2605; Choosing Conversation Topics which Exclude Me

- in social situations with family members, they (sister & mother)
  seek to choose conversation topics which actively exclude me and limit
  conversation topics which my draw my interest or inclusion.
  - this is really a metric of how much someone wants you included in
    any situation.
  - in positive social situations, the people you are socializing will
    choose conversation subjects which demonstrate your skills, your
    social appeal, your positive traits, allow you to assert your
    identity and allow you to develop stronger connections with
    others!
  - in situations where some participants harbor negativity and
    resentment, you may find that these people leverage the subject of
    discussion and type of interactions to:
    - those which confer strenth/influence to themselves
      - that is, they are selfish
      - they monopolize conversation, etc
      - this really can't be helped and often signifies defect of
        personality. some people just do this
    - OR: far from a simple defect of personality, they activiely
      limit your exposure to cultivate positive relationships by
      employing such tactics as monoploization of conversation, etc
  - if u experience this enough, you'll notice such simple-minded tactics:
    - monopolization of conversation,
    - restriction of topics to discussion.
  - if it's truly happening AND IS OBVIOUS
    - THEN OTHER PEOPLE WILL BEGIN TO NOTICE
    - starting with the people who know you and are aware of tension

- again, when someone uses such simple-minded, rude, social tactics
  against someone who has difficulty learning about such social
  phenomena, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EITHER:
  - THEY ARE WILLFULLY IGNORANT OF ASPERGER'S **AT BEST!**
  - OR THEY ARE WILLFULLY USING YOUR DIAGNOSES' SOCIAL INEPTITUDE
    AGAINST YOU!!
    - HOLY FUCKING SHIT NO FUCKING WAY WHO THE FUCK WOULD DO THAT?!
    - OH!!! Oh!!!!!! YOUR FAMILY DOES THAT TO YOU?!!! YOUR FAMILY!!!??
    - LEVERAGES WHAT TO PLACE YOU IN A CONSTANT STATE OF ISOLATION AND
      DISADVANTAGE?! YOUR DIAGNOSIS OF ASPERGERS?!
    - Your
      [refrigerator mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator_mother_theory)
      does what? Intentionally?

#### &#x2605; Playing Ignorant when it comes to mental health actions


#### &#x2605; They Disregard the Reality of my Chronic Depression



#### &#x2605; They Disregard the reality of my Emotional Trauma & PTSD



#### &#x2605; They Disregard the reality of my Asperger's


#### &#x2605; Through their response to my appeals for help in any situation by invoking Guilt/Shame/Anxiety

so why should it come as a surprise that I'm hardly proactive about
reaching for psychological help?

#### &#x2605; Willful Disregard of My Statements and Arguments

There is no intellectual consequence when I talk to my family
- Mostly my mother, brother & sister.
  - They simply don't absorb any of my statements or arguments
  - There is no consequence to a discussion unless it moves me into a
    more disadvantageous disposition.
- it's as if they have been told to disregard what I say until such
  time when I can be locked away.
  - almost like they've been trained to treat me this way
- At best, it is as if they approach the situation believing that all
  of my statements & actions are to be regarded as the statements &
  actions of lunatic. That is, they approach any of my statements as
  though there is no basis in reality. As though, I should be wearing
  a straight jacket.
  - when, in fact, I have a coherent

At worst, it's as if they willfully disregard any of my statements as
part of an attempt to put me in a worse position.
- To cut off any aid/attention from others; to prevent from having too
  look or feel responsible for anything in my situation.

#### &#x2605;

#### &#x2605; No emphasis on routines (part of a total lack of realistic planning)

Tie into Aspergers Diagnosis
- this demonstrates willful ignorance of my diagnosis

#### &#x2605; Acting like they're the sole benefactors in my life.

- like I would have nothing else to fall back on
  - the intent here is to stoke my fear and compel me to remain
    cornered by emphasizing that I have no other options
  - while refusing to offer any further assistance
- "no one else has ever helped you" is a terrible message to drive
  home day after day, week after week
  - especially to someone who needs help, in general
  - and, specically, to someone who needs help with an abusive
    relationship (that of my mother)
- but this statement "we are the only one's who have ever helped you,
  no one else is will help you" is a staple in almost every single
  argument I have with my mom
  - this is one of her general fallback tactics, when she's close to
    losing an argument, she will invariable make this and other
    statements in an attempt to distract me.
  - she utilizes my poor short-term memory against me, which is
    another sign that she would use my own mental health issues
    against me.
  - so, she seeks to distract me from real progress, when discussing
    almost any issue.
    - she is antithetical to any real progress
    - she harbors intense negativity towards me in her heart
    - she does not want me to be successful, EVER
    - she actively wants me to fail.
    - she wants me to fail in a way that allows her to retain
      influence in how the story of my life is conveyed to other
      people.
    - she does not want to accept any accountability for my
      mis-treatment.
    - IT IS ABOUT SAVING FACE AND AVOIDING FAULT.
    - IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR DAVID CONNER.
    - IT IS ABOUT "HOW DO I LOOK LIKE I DIDN'T SET UP THIS MENTAL HEALTH TRAINWRECK"


    my mental health,
    family,


#### &#x2605; Gaslighting me

-

#### &#x2605; Generally shaming me or guilting me for everything

#### &#x2605; Shaming me for reaching out for medical & mental health

- shaming me for cost

#### &#x2605; They guilt me for lack of social maturity, while
 restricting learning experiences

 They continue to restricting me from experiencing the events which
 would provoke the kind of social maturation that occurs in 20-30 year
 olds. This

I can't emphasize how cruel this is. I have Asperger's. I don't know
how else to say it. I would have been much better off, but **I lacked
virtually all social interaction b/w the ages 20 to 30.** How can you
expect someone to socially develop who is intentionally isolated,
while subject to emotional trauma leaving him with PTSD. This occurs
with virtually zero emotional support system, where the people who are
supposed to be the strongest connections instead contribute to the
shaming and mentally corroding tactics.

It occurs for about a decade. And then the person who experiences the
pain, who's much worse off emotionally, is the person at fault?! When
can someone else accept some responsibility here?! How is it fair to
expect me to pick myself up? IT'S NOT! It is unrealistic to expect me
to do so and it implies that my family, at best, lacks a rational
plan.  And worse, it may imply their cooperation in a plan to
discredit and destabilize me.

Observing everything first-hand leaves me wondering how this perfect
storm of mental health treatment came together.

#### &#x2605; Their idea of "Treatment Plan" is wait idly by until
they have induced enough depression/aggrivation/guilt/shame to induce
some reaction that justifies locking me away, while claiming they were
simply "too busy" with their own lives and "it never was their problem
anyways"

#### &#x2605; Suppression of Propagation of Information Related to My Situation

#### &#x2605; Active Avoidance of Discussion of Problems or Treatment Plan

#### &#x2605; Active Avoidance of Discussion of PTSD or Asperger's

#### &#x2605; Active Engagement in Behavior which Exacerbates PTSD & Asperger's

#### &#x2605; Connections are not shared

#### &#x2605; Only negative information is propagated through the family's social connections

#### &#x2605; My social naivety is used against me. I am never informed to correct for negative behaviors; There are active attempts to prevent me from being exposed to or learning positive behaviors

#### &#x2605; Never rewarded with training on skills or experience. My
 brother and employees at the rink actively seek to prevent me from
 learning new on-the-job skills, which would improve my hireability!!

#### &#x2605; Restriction of new social/work experiences, from which I could learn!

#### &#x2605; Constantly guilted and shamed and controlled through
 invocation of negative emotional responses. In other words, my family,
 through their actions/reactions, compels me to suffer in a swamp of
 negative emotions. They exacerbate my depression and I know that my
 mom does this intentionally.

#### &#2605; There are active attempts to




- i'm glad i don't have the simple duplication of knowledge that
  most people in life have, spoonfed to them by academic
  institutions. the level of passion that i feel when i am
  absorbing new knowledge could have only ever been sparked
  through years of struggling with ignorance and imagination.
  - i was scared when i realized i had no idea how to start a
    business. i saw my level of ignorance of the legal,
    logistic, social and administrative hurdles of doing so and
    that's the seed that I planted in myself in 2007. the only
    time I had thought about starting a business before that was
    in 2005 when I read about George Soros and found myself a
    bit jealous that it would be "easy" for him to affect policy
    and politics. obviously, it's not actually "easy" for a
    billionaire to make such changes.
  - Since 2007, I have been driven by the prospect of being
    rewarded by hard work. i knew it would be hard to start a
    business, but when i failed so miserably in social life, i
    eventually decided I didn't care. It wasn't worth my time
    and I would sacrifice as much time previously invested in
    social life as possible. so, yes, i see myself as having
    made immense sacrifices for the kind of life that i wanted
    to pursue and I'm very angry to see how people interfered
    before 2013. i feel like i was kept purposefully ignorant of
    many facets of life, so that i would remain at a
    disadvantage. today, the possibility that someone in my
    personal or professional life would try to shield me from
    experience or knowledge infuriates me, though i acknowledge
    that often i'm mistaken.
    - however, i simply don't give a !@#$ if I'm wrong that
      someone is purposefully shielding me from
      experience/knowledge... why? BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A SINGLE
      PERSON ENGAGING *ME* IN MY PERSONAL/PROFESSIONAL LIFE TO
      ADDRESS A PERSONAL DEFICIT OF KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCE, or
      SOCIAL INTERACTION/CONNECTION
      - i.e. these are minimized in my life, as though someone
        is using linear regression to find the optimal means of
        passively surpressing me while acting like they had no
        influence on my life.

- I wanted sooo badly to understand business models, economics,
  fluid dynamics, mathematics, philosophy, chaos theory, my
  shortcomings with social life, haskell, how to write myself a
  haskell, etc. etc.
  - i can't !@#$'ing blow the leaves or mow the yard or pour sugar
    into water without visualizing and becoming bewildered with
    maths i don't understand.
    - i look around and it seems that:
      - (1) the smarter children a decade younger have an
        insurmountable advantage from online education
      - (2) the things i want to learn which are so trivial for me
        to absorb seem to be very difficult for
        others.
        - i.e. others in life, others in my profession, my
          teachers, people i look up to, etc.
        - for them? these subjects/topics/questions are:
          - completely unknown
          - prohibitively difficult
          - a worthwhile challenge
          - something learned in college but forgot
          - rarely something they picked up easily
          - rarely something they want to explain
          - something used for work and .... eugh it's work --
            they just don't want to talk about it. they don't have
            that same passion
      - (3) and finally, it just seems that no one in my current
        personal life gives a flying !@#$ about what i do with my
        time.
        - it's amazing. people will complain about how much money
          i require, but never about how efficiently i spend my
          time.
        - worse, if *I, MYSELF*, feel that i've begun using
          my time wisely and i'm efficiently making progress on
          some subject or project -- THAT is precisely when my mom
          interferes with a positive, productive pattern.
          - this specific point: i keep stressing it. i feel guilty
            for doing so, but i'll mention it to friends, family, and
            whoever doesn't ignore me and the best response i get is
            basically: `you're paranoid! I heard about you. you're
            crazy. my friends say the doctors say so. your own mother
            simply wouldn't sabotage you or seek to distract you from
            being productive. that's not what she said. she says she
            cares so much about you and she just doesn't
            understand. you can't get mad at her if she doesn't
            understand` ~> not literal, but i get the feeling that's
            the frame of almost any conversation where I braindump my
            life on someone or ask for help
          - honestly though: i simply do not give a !@#$ about
            whether my mom thinks she is or is not sabotaging my
            projects or learning in life. i just don't care if
            that's what she intends or doesn't intend. in fact, if
            that is so, it's morbidly depressing! that's not the
            reality i want.
            - quite simply: what I want? to have a COMMUNITY. Why?
              so that the single person with which i have 99% of
              conversations longer than 60 seconds is not my
              mother.
            - the stats on social interactions and connections in
              my life (for someone who is often accused of having
              mental health issues) IS ALARMING.
              - it should alarm people that i have almost ZERO
                conversations with people for longer than 60
                seconds, but i am absolutely not exagerating when
                i say that one or two months passed in 2016 where
                I may not have spoken with more than 5 people for
                longer than 60s (in phone, online, in person,
                whatever)
              - people wonder why i vent on social media? because
                the fucking facebook and twitter textboxes can't
                ignore me. i detest being in situations where
                someone simply expects you to not say
                something. that's the trick of a con-artist.
                - "oh, it doesn't matter if you do X or cause Y or
                  say Z to his face. don't worry about it. HE
                  WON'T SAY SHIT"
                - i'm simply not going to let that happen. when i
                  tweet controversial or depressing shit it's
                  because it's a cry for help. it's because it
                  feels like there is not a single person who
                  *LISTENS* to what i say or what I write.
                - i'm not in danger of hurting myself, so it's not
                  that kind of cry for help. instead, it's someone
                  who knows exactly how other people are
                  un/intentionally restricting his social
                  life. this person understands that, to succeed,
                  he needs to:
                  - (1) talk to more people
                  - (2) talk to people who share interests in:
                    intellectual topics, startups, etc.
                  - (3) be able to run small talk with other
                    people (without going insane from isolation
                    and never having an outlet for intellectual
                    topics)
                  - (4) make IRL social appearances at events,
                    meetups, etc where like-minded people attend
                  - (5) strengthen connections with both old and
                    new friends
                  - (6) generally increase quantity and quality of
                    total connection
                  - (7) demonstrate value and relevance after
                    career assassination in a world that has
                    derided this person as literally schizophrenic
                    (falsely)
                  - (8) increase the number of locations that i
                    frequent (which is restrained by my TOTAL lack
                    of income)
                    - this makes me incredibly predictable (where
                      am i today?! *i'm at the !@#$'ing coffee
                      shop*! why? because i can focus there and it
                      costs me two dollars to sit and eat walnuts)
                      wants to ruin my life, then this is
                      incredibly *convenient*. the targeted
                      individual can be dependably restrained to a
                      minimal number of locations (after being
                      subjected to career assassination and
                      deprived of income)
                    - these gangstalkers don't need to guess where
                      i'm going to be *because they already know
                      that at ANY time of day, there is a 50%
                      chance that I'm at the coffee shop in salem,
                      va.
                      - therefore, it's quantifyably simpler and
                        statistically preferable for a group of
                        gangstalkers who'd want to [1] show up in
                        a place that person frequents or [2] staff
                        individuals to scope those locations.
                        - it's !@#$'ing *MATH*. once someone has
                          been virtually blacklisted and their
                          family is tired of feeling the
                          thumbscrews, that person is deprived of
                          income and has no where to
                          go. quantifyably, they have both fewer
                          locations available to frequent and
                          fewer types of actions available to
                          them.
                  - (9) manage to dodge the people that
                    un/intentionally do this person social harm
                    - and i swear to God, there really is a group
                      of people that is "out to get me" and i have
                      no fucking clue who it is, but this group of
                      people wants nothing other than to ensure
                      that they *passive aggressively* ruin my
                      life.
                    - i don't really care who these people are and
                      i'd prefer to ignore the thoughts that there
                      are such groups of people. the harm that any
                      group of people could do to an individual
                      simply cannot outweigh the good that
                      individual can do for him or her self, in
                      life.
                      - this is precisely why it is paramount that
                        i prevent myself from being scrubbed out
                        of life and all-but-socially erased.
            - again, i don't actually care why i'm in this
              particular spot. but those nine or ten factors
              above? i realizes that if I manage to qualitatively
              improve *just one of them* that my life is
              better. only one of those points involves paranoid
              assumptions (#9) and I mentioned that i do not give
              a fuck about whether it's true
              - every other point above is simply something that
                quantitatively improves ANY INDIVIDUAL'S social
                life.
  - my passion and ignorance have been at odds with my imagination
    for well over a decade.
- step four: load them on my kindle and pretend like i might
  actually read 200,000 pages of content someday

- Step 3 seems slow and stupid, but actually initiates the
  process of internalizing the knowledge: i'm quickly reviewing
  everything and it takes way longer than it should, but i'm
  prestructuring the content in my head
  - again, it's incredibly inefficient (then again no one
    assists me learning at home or even encourages me, so it's
    not like i have very many options as alternatives)
    - this is good and bad. i would prefer a community i can
      easily associate with me. most people would have given up
      a long, long time ago...
    - but the fact that there are ZERO people in my *personal*
      life who seem concerned with *encouraging me*, it means
      that the only way to avoid giving up on learning about all
      these fascinating subjects is to adamantize my resolve and
      refuse to give in to reality
      - reality: i have made less than $400 this year
      - also reality: i am an incredibly talented person who
        deserves opportunity and for whom it would be tragic for
        his talent for learning to remain untapped.
        - there is a huge divide b/w the way society treats me
          and my skillset and unquenchable passion for learning.
        - I COULD DO SO MUCH MORE FOR SOCIETY IF I HAD
          *COMMUNITY*. i am simply not connected to a community
          of people who encourages me to develop, which is
          partially my own social failure. it's incredibly sad,
          but if it's not easy for me to tap into such a
          community, i just don't. in roanoke, it is VERY
          DIFFICULT for me to tap into such a community
        - again, i know what it feels like to have a hackerspace
          or coworking space right down the street (that is
          simply not true for me, in roanoke)
          - similarly, i know what it feels like to have to
            choose between 2 or 3 technology, etc. meetups
            *every single weekday*
          - i know what that feels like *to actually have a
            community* that drives me to learn, but I DO NOT
            HAVE IT IN ROANOKE. if i had never left roanoke, i
            might not know what that feels like or how "normal"
            it feels to the programmers and academics who live
            in those areas.
          - worse still, in roanoke, it's my past that holds me back:
            80% of the shit i shovel in roanoke is (or at least, WAS)
            from people's pre-existing impression of me and my life.


- i feel like i've learned more in each September, October and
  November, than I have in the second half of 2016
  - why? because I know I'm learning about topics which i have
    mostly unexplored. many of them are intuitive for me, but
    i'm beginning to realize that some personal beliefs of mine
    have been:
    - (1) factually incorrect at times (and laughably so --
      which is how i begin to realize how EASY it would be for
      people to inform me so)
      - occasionally i can deduce that people either weren't or
        aren't on my side because they couldn't be bothered to
        call me out.
        - often it's because they didn't have the time or energy
        - or they didn't want to tell me i was wrong
      - but god !@#$$# sometimes it's because they just wanted
        me to remain disempowered or continue sounding stupid.
        - the number of times this occured is fairly rare, but i
          look back on the conversations i had and realize how
          little anyone ever said to me.
        - it's most obvious when it's trivial for someone to
          correct you (e.g. white eggs are white because they've
          been bleached. no! that's laughably wrong and requires
          minimal investment to correct. i still laugh at this,
          btw)

- whatever people in my life throw my way when i begin visibly
  demonstrating progress. seriously, it feels like at all times,
  there is a handful of people with significant influence in my
  life, whose *objective* is to prevent me from accomplishing
  anything but homelessness in my life.
  - it feels like this group of people has signed away some
    plea-bargin whereby their testicles get squeezed out in a vice
    grip if i'm not homeless/etc by 2030
  - as in, straight up mafia tactics, but legal, encouraged and
    *incredibly illegal to talk about without significant
    ramifications*
  - in late 2015 & in 2016, for the first time in my life, i saw
    that people who i had known for months and years begin to
    interact with me *fearfully*
    - "there is nothing to fear but fear itself" and i saw it, in
      their eyes. and i understood, perhaps incorrectly, that if i
      connect to them or depend on them or engage with them, they
      may end up paying a price for it...
      - *that* is a really, really, shitty feeling, by the way.
      - in the past few months, i don't often get this vibe from
        friends/strangers old or new. it was the way they looked
        at me. i don't know how to explain it and i couldn't
        discern whether it was true or not, but it did not feel
        very good.
      - and because i felt that it was fear or nervousness
        stemming from me, I felt guilty relying on these people,
        opting instead to become more isolated, which has been
        driving all of my problems.

### tactics to distract

- as much as others claim to help, 95% of what i'm asking for is
  refused with tactics that control/derail the conversation
  - e.g. make david angry about something. anything. it's easy.
  - e.g. make david guilty about something. anything. it's easy.
  - e.g. make david know that it's his fault. everything.
  - e.g. generally prefer to avoid conversations with david, if at all
    possible. (the flipside of this is that it limits my desire to
    engage in conversations)
  - e.g. do not budge on anything. the stakes are high (apparently)
  - so, anytime i ask for something, there are about 6 tactics i find
    employed against me, which strain the relationship and make me
    feel like i should rather not ask for anything at all.
    - this stands in contrast to the simplicity of many suggestions i
      have described for:
      - (1) improving my social life
      - (2) improving the efficiency of processes related to a project
      (app or startup)
      - (3) helping me find other people who can help me on a project,
        distract me from my pain, etc.
- the people in my life are *so* good at this (i.e. *handling* me) IT
  IS AS IF SOMEONE HAS *TRAINED* THEM TO DO SO. it's as if someone has
  trained them to handle "difficult situations with david conner" with
  words/actions/tactics that are designed to escalate any interaction
  so that it *becomes* my fault.
  - "no i can't give you that because look at how (pick one: angry,
    ungrateful, guilty, burdensome, worthless, hopeless, etc.) you
    are"
    - it is as if someone has conditioned my mom, specifically, to
    handle me in this way and convinced her that it is what is best
    for me...
- and all i can do is blame my mom... that is pathetic,
  regardless. but my only choice is to give up on everything i've
  dreamed & planned & struggled to do.
  - the only answer seems to be that someone wants me to be a
    loser. that someone has determined that, regardless of how it
    happens, the conclusion is foregone and known to all:
    - DAVID CONNER IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE *AND ALWAYS MUST BE A FAILURE,*
      so that we can hold him up as an example to others.
- it is incredibly fucked up

### surreptitious medication

- wasting time inspecting my food & eating utensils, trying to
  avoid surreptitious medication. it's basically impossible, by
  the way, unless you can lock your refridgerator
  - it also helps to have your own refridgerator, which i recently
    gave away.
  - it sounds crazy, but i have absolutely been drugged w/o my
    knowledge, at least a handful of times. it has happened and
    it's terrifying to think about. no one should even have to
    worry about that.
    - there is "topical" haldol/valium/diphenhydramine paste,
      which is highly potent, but which studies show to be
      ineffective TOPICALLY. orally, however, it is potent enough
      to smudge in someone's cup or on their food. haldol has a
      very long halflife, so one dose lasts one to three days.
    - there is literally no *practical* use case for this
      medication, besides surreptitious medication. it is
      ineffective, topically.
    - search for surreptitious medication. you will find that it
      has only been trending for the past decade and almost
      unheard of before 2000. at the same time, most people are
      completely unaware that such a practice is even possible or
      legal. the haldol paste was developed by Braeburn
      Pharmaceuticals (?) only a few years ago.
      - furthermore, out-patient surreptitious medication implies
        that someone close to that patient has:
        - (1) knowledge of their *complete* medical history, since
          the last thing such an adversary/nurse wants to do is
          induce an overdose
          - this is complicated by substance abuse, but presents
            minimal problems for someone whose life is
            micromanaged and who has no income
        - (2) a trusting relationship with the patient
        - (3) frequent contact with the patient, since to limit
          possible exposure of the information, the person
          supplying the medication must have common contact with
          the patient and enough trust to put it in their food or
          apply it topically.
          - for such controversial treatments, if they are applied
            out-patient, it is preferable to limit this to one
            person.
            - therefore, it should be a roommate, a family member,
              a coworker or a really sheisty friend. keep in mind,
              *private*, up-to-date medical information must be
              sent & received. this person must (should) have
              legal authority to have custody of their
              information. or at least, there must be some legal
              mechanism for shielding this person from questions
              surrounding medication.
            - that is, unless there is a government institution
              that does it. interestingly, FDA code & regulations
              do not prohibit this (AFAIK)
              - FDA code, regulations, forms and documentation
                prompted me with an endless amount of questions.
          - i don't think this happens very often. if at all,
            there are probably less than a thousand patients with
            out-patient surreptitious medication. there's simply
            too much risk in the processes and way too much red
            tape if something goes wrong.
        - (4) legal authority to medicate the patient
          - there's a concept in medical administration which is
            similar to "chain of custody" for evidence, but for
            patients. at all times, in a hospital, each patient's
            current care/responsibility must be known and
            documented. each treatment that is applied must fall
            through a chain of command and it must be known who is
            responsible for each aspect of the patient's
            treatment. this documented authority should apply
            moreso if the patient is unaware of their medication.
        - (5) approval and payment by the insurance company for
          the medication. and for the services of a compounding
          pharmacy, for which the FDA regulations changed less
          than three years ago. Haldol paste is made by
          compounding pharmacies.
        - (6) the pharmacy & compounding pharmacy must have
          approval of the DEA to possess medications for which
          they do not have a prescription
        - (7) knowledge of the pharmacist and whoever is involved
          in (quietly!) transferring the prescription order to a
          compounding pharmacy
      - so, again, unless the surreptitious medication and action
        of medication is ordered & processed by DHS/CIA/etc, then
        it is simply not feasible enough to be a widespread
        occurance.
        - it simply involves:
          - too many people
          - too much risk of overdose & legal complications
          - too much risk of information exposure
          - too much risk of legal complications (malpractice, etc)
          - too much work/process to convince people that it is
            ethical and necessary.
        - furthermore, there is no way to deliver the treatment in
          a scientifically responsible manner. there is absolutely
          no way to ensure that the patient's blood plasma
          medication level does not fluctuate widely. therefore,
          it's unethical because it is unscientific
    - there is also a subcutaneous haldol implant. it's like a
      birth control implant, but for people who are difficult to
      manage. maybe they have DSM V's invented "BPD borderline
      personality disorder" for people who are "too close to the
      border"
      - furthermore, few responsible psychiatrists would prescribe
        a haldol implant. doing so would require at least 6 months
        of psychiatric medication history. since difficult to
        remove an implant, it's *irresponsibly* and *possibly
        fatal* to prescribe/mandate such an implant if they have a
        bad reaction to the medication.
        - the implant is marketed on the plausible basis that "it's
          easier for the patient to manage their medication" --
          they can't forget to take it, which is true, but doesn't
          outweigh the logistic difficulty of establishing patient
          care long enough to trust the patient to not
          accidentally induce an overdose, amoung other issues.
          - schizophrenic patient drinks alcohol? i'm not a
            psychiatrist, but sorry, they probably shouldn't have
            the haldol implant, ever.
            - furthermore, substance abuse is comorbid with
              schizophrenia
        - any responsible psychiatrist prescribing such treatment
          would need at least 6 months of medication history with
          that patient before allowing

#### Referencing Childhood Signs/Symptoms of Autism

From: david conner
To: Chris Conner; Chris Conner; Temple Fennell; Perry
Sent: Mon, Jan 28, 2013 10:44 am
Subject: Asperger's

Just wanted to put this list of traits together so that people might
understand what i'm going through a little more.  There was a time I
went to a neurologist when I was a kid and I'm pretty sure I remember
them trying to diagnose me with Aspergers/PDD-NOS.  They tried to
diagnose me with something they weren't sure I could handle as a kid.
I remember they mentioned something with a lot of letters and that it
was on the autism spectrum, which really confused.  It's not what my
mom wanted to hear, to say the least.  And I knew Harry Hoyt had
autism and I didn't think I had it.  I do wish I could see those
medical records.

I haven't told many people about this, but I'm pretty sure that I have
it.  I've been to 2 doctors now that both suggested it as a diagnosis
to look into.  I think everyone agrees that you need to move forward
with looking into an Asperger's diagnosis so that you know what to do
next.  Whenever I tell those people about this, they either tell me
that they already assumed that it might be the case.  Or they tell me
that autism is something completely different and there's no way.
Some people already have this picture in their head of what autism
"looks like".  And this is wrong, because as they say: when you have
seen one case of autism that means you have seen one case of autism.

I am very confident that I have either Aspergers or PDD-NOS (which is
basically another term for the same thing, where people don't have
traits prominent enough for either Aspergers or Autism).  I'm trying
to put this list together because i have a hard time explaining things
to people.  Especially my family, who seems to be more concerned with
telling me what i'm doing wrong before I get the chance to really say
anything substantial, thereby diverting the conversation completely.
And no one seems to understand what i'm going through.

I don't want to be treated as someone with a disorder, but some
sometimes I need people to emphasize certain things.  Sometimes if
you're trying to convey something, you to be direct about it.
Otherwise, I may interpret what you're saying completely wrong.  And i
tend to get withdrawn into the basement and not communicate at all.
It's hard for me to communicate with friends to make sure i have
something to do on the weekend.  And even harder to get permission
from mom to do anything.  She hates anything and anyone associated
with me.

And i really don't know whether or not to tell anyone.  I want to so
other people understand why I can be awkward sometimes or so they can
understand me better.  Part of me is afraid because of the sociopathic
kind of people i've dealt with in the past.  I'm afraid that I'll
basically give them a map that allows them to game me more
effectively.  Not too many people have your best interests at heart.

And I can't believe you're saying that you don't think I'm going to do
anything with my life.  Speaking for myself, and probably everyone
else, I know you are capable of doing great things.  What is
frustrating, is to watch you make deliberate choices that keep you
from "doing anything with your life."And i knew that was the case,
that people in my family think this, because of how certain people are
acting in my life.  I really don't understand why you see me that way.
And this is creating all kinds of negativity towards me, both from the
people around me and from myself.  How can you expect someone to
succeed like that?  My entire family is treating me like some kind of
cautionary tale to my nieces and nephews.  Like i'm someone who needs
to handled in a special way and ultimately humiliated so other people
can "learn a lesson" .. Do you understand how that makes me feel?
Because it's not good.

And i feel like my mom treats me like some kind of unwanted dog that
needs to be kept in the basement and out of sight.  Mom is, has been
and always will be your biggest defender, I'll bet that there is
nothing Temple or myself could do that would make mom smile more than
to see you succeed.  Please consider that whatever diagnosis you have
could easily be applied to mom as well.  The things she says are so
messed up.  I do not think she is a positive influence on my life at
this moment.  She purposely misinterprets things I say and she plays
dumb and just doesn't listen to me.  And I do not get angry with other
people, but she knows how to push my buttons and she does.  Call me
paranoid, but I feel like she wants to see me fail.  I definitely
don't feel like she is a loving or supportive mother right now.  And
no one ever listens to my side of the story.  Man, as someone who has
spent a lot of time listening to you on the phone, that is hard to
hear.  This is partly because i just don't communicate and partly
BECAUSE I"M STUCK IN THE BASEMENT.  NO ONE EVER SEES ME.

And if you still don't understand why I'm afraid to get a new job,
here's two websites dedicated to work issues for people with
Aspergers:

If you are going to stay afraid of getting a job, how are you going to
move forward?  In other words, how are you going to combat your fear,
or any other roadblock in your way?

Autistic Traits:

Repetitive Motions:
- bouncing my feet at my desk, since elementary school.
- constantly told to stop fidgeting
- moving(not grinding) teeth to a rhythm.  done this since at least 9th grade.
- cracking knuckles
- tendency to incorporate breakdancing-like movements into otherwise
  everyday normal motions
	- i might just be standing around, but start to move my feet like
      in skating footwork
	- or i might be laying down and decide to use some kind of overly
      dramatic move to get up.  hard to explain.
- tapping paradiddles since at least elementary school, though i
  didn't know what paradiddles were.
	- i would repeat the pattern(LRLL) like a fractal:
		LRLL (left, first set)
		RLRR (right, first set)
		LRLL
		LRLL
		RLRR (start of second set, this one starts on right)
		… (this is kind of a hard thing to explain)

Limited Empathy:
- unaware of how others viewed my actions
- i picked my nose pretty much constantly until the 5th grade
	- never understood why people would think it was gross (until i got older of course)
	- never considered the people around me when i did it
- i whined and cried in order to pick the restaurant i wanted to go to
- i farted in a girls face in the first grade
	- to see what would happen (because i needed to see to understand).
	- there are a lot of instances of things i did, just to see what would happen
		- even though it should have been pretty obvious
- unable to keep a secret as a kid
- constantly played video games by myself
	- and let my friends watch
	- this is basically what 75% of my play time consisted of in elementary school
- unaware of the importance of sharing to making others feel good
- unaware of the importance of letting others win sometimes
- no desire to give gifts as a child
	- this is still a problem
- not good at certain kinds of dancing
	- breakdancing power-moves - yes
		- although it took me YEARS to understand how to do top rock
		- but i was doing power moves very quickly
	- hip-hop/poplocking - no
		- this is because i'm not good at perceiving how others are moving
		- and apply it to my own movements
		- and i can't break down what others are doing
	- i have no expression when i'm skating
		- and i don't pay attention to what my arms are doing
- unaware of how to tactfully phrase certain things
	- how to tell someone they are wrong without making them feel bad
	- how to respond to someone who just experienced something really bad
		- in order to make them feel better
		- often you need to find a way to distract them
		- or say something counterintuitive that you know is false
- limited ability to consider the ramifications of things i said or did
- sometimes i would tell kids something negative about something
	- like "you're dumb" or "that's stupid"
	- without realize how it would make people feel
	- my mom always had to tell me to "think before i spoke"
	- it's because thinking about these things is not instinctive for me
- after i had started smoking marijuana
	- i was very public about usage and legalization
	- thought that the only reason prohibition persisted is because people were afraid to speak out
	- constantly posting things online
	- never thought about the consequences of introducing other people to drugs	- never thought about the professional consequences
	- never thought about the social consequences, where people just abandon you for no reason
- posting too much information on social networks
	- though this is common for a lot of people
	- sometimes, i'm just not concerned about who's going to see it or what they will think
- persistently made fun of a few kids, even though later on i felt bad about this
	- this caused me to reinforce these negative behaviors over other positive ones
	- this was really the only way i knew how to make kids laugh
	- it was negative, and once it realized what it was making people feel like, it was too late
		- i had already reinforced these behaviors (and other negative ones)
		- so now that i've decided to never pick on people (or do these other negative behaviors)
			- i don't have too much else to fall back on, because i didn't reinforce anything else
			- and i don't know any other ways to make people laugh
- it's very hard for me to show love to someone else
	- because i'm afraid of putting myself out there
	- or because i don't know how to do it right
	- or because i'm not mindful enough to do it right

Lack of spontaneousness:
- found it very hard to write papers in english
	- because i found it hard to find the words i wanted to use and what i wanted to say
	- the general argument of the paper was fairly easy for me to come up with
- completely unable to perform some forms of spontaneous play:
	- especially pushing/shoving when just playing around with others
	- or making physical contact with a girl
	- or just saying random silly things that have no meaning
		- i'm afraid to say the wrong thing
		- or i take too long to come up with something similar to what was said immediately before
		- because i'm trying to identify the pattern and mimic it, but can't
	- it is because i'm unable to break these things down to a formula
		- and that's because there is no formula: they're spontaneous
	- and it's also because i'm afraid to break social norms
		- these are social norms i don't really understand
- it's difficult to
	- come up with names for characters in an english assignment
	- generate phrases that have no apparent meaning or formula
- it's easy to
	- extrapolate and interpolate new content (or skating moves) when there is a formula
	- when there is an obvious pattern, things like this become easier

Completely unaware of body language until i was >25
- i thought body language was something people did unconsciously
	- and that it simply showed your emotions, like anger or sadness
- not aware of how to visually block my hands or arms
	- from the people i didn't want to see
	- to convey messages to specific people
- unsure of how people perceive my body language
	- probably use completely inappropriate
- completely unaware that as friends develop stronger relationships,
	- they develop systems of communication which include specific body language
	- so they can communicate without being heard or understood by others
		- used to escape awkward situations
		- used to convey opinions about new people
- people always told me in my early 20's not to cross my arms
	- because it was "bad body language"
	- i had a real hard time understanding this at all
	- i just wanted to cross my arms
- unable to effectively use body language to help communicate things i can't say out loud
	- unsure of what body language will be interpreted
	- and how it will be interpreted by other people
- able to acknowledge some facial expressions
	- sometimes if i acknowledge them, i can tell if they are simply 'good' or 'bad'
		- but i don't know what they mean, specifically
		- or i'm unable to use them
	- and i'm not able to use facial expressions very well

Intense focus in sometimes narrow subjects
- Nintendo
	- because when i was playing mario, i actually had control of the situation and i could win
	- i didn't realize it at the time, but i wasn't able to achieve this success socially, so i didn't try
- Skating
	- able to practice >6 days a week
	- able to understand jam skating moves on a level that completely surpassed others
	- able to break jam skating moves down to a formula
		- that i could use to discover new moves and new variations
		- at a rate faster than anyone else IN THE WORLD - period
	- the "Rodney Mullen" of jam skating
	- made a lot of people in the skating world angry because of things i said
		- mostly because i didn't consider other people's feelings when i said them
- Drug Legalization
- Piano
- Programming/Computers
- Politics and Current Events
- Startups and Business Models
- Other intellectual or philosophic subjects
- i tend to get overexcited when i talk about certain subjects that i am passionate about
	- my tone of voice changes and i start talking with prosody
	- i don't know when to stop, or i don't care
		- because i don't have anyone to talk to about these interests
	- this is actually what prompted the first person to ask whether i had aspergers
		- i had NEVER heard of it
		- this happened when i was 24

Sensory Overload:
- almost to the point of selective mutism (completely unable to speak in certain situations)
	- theres so much going on when i'm around more than one person
- sometimes irritated by long sleeves
- can't focus when there's too much stuff in my desk
- can't focus when there's too much motion in my field of view
	- it's very distracting and immediately interrupts my thought
- i get irritated when my mom's driving and she's moving her fingers (not just mom)
	- and i really pisses me off when she does that on purpose
	- i specifically don't tell her things she does that irritate me
	- because she WILL do those things on purpose

Social
- tendency to hide during social situations
	- always crawling under tables when out to eat (this is something many people report)
- always had the same friends, never really broke out and tried to meet new people
- very quiet unless i know you
- i'm not shy because of a lack of confidence
- it's just that i have no content (alogia)
	- i can't "shoot the shit" and get to know someone
	- i can't think of something worth saying in time (or at all, usually)
	- so i just sit there
- completely unable to understand manners and etiquette
	- at least at more than an intellectual level
	- for example, i know that it's a bad to do certain things, but i don't know why
	- and i was always asking why when i was a kid
	- hated cotillion and other superficial social interactions/events
- one sided conversations
	- unable to really gauge whether someone is interested or not
	- usually just assume that they are not or will not be interested
		- now that my confidence has been hurt anyways
- only able to carry on conversations when i'm one on one
	- if theres more than one other person, i withdraw and just listen
	- this is partially because of the sensory overload
	- and partially because of the difficulty in coming up with things to say
- now that i understand that people think i'm awkward or whatever
	- this causes me to withdraw even more
	- i'm not really afraid to approach people, but i just don't want to
		- mostly because i have nothing to say that they are going to be interested in
		- i know the conversation is going to last a few sentences
			- and i'm not going to have anything to follow up with
			- and i'm not able to predict the direction the conversation is going to take
		- i know i'm going to fumble over things i say
		- or in the case of girls:
			- i already know that some unconscious facial expression or phrasing
			- will set the frame of the conversation so that the girl just thinks i'm just trying to 'get with her'
			- so they will treat the interaction within that frame, turn on the bitch shield
			- and get rid of me as quickly as possible
- i tend to want to use non-verbal communication
	- like texting/email
	- this gives me a chance to include everything i want to say
	- i don't have to worry about
	- i've been trying to increase verbal communication, but it's just not easy

i'm easily "gamed" and manipulated by others
- once people understand that i'm altruistic (not autistic)
	- then they can break me down to a formula
	- they understand that i will strictly adhere to my beliefs/morals
	- and some people have exploited that to game me
	- for example, they will ask me about my stance on legalization or other political beliefs
		- knowing that i won't be afraid to talk about it (for the most part)
		- even though i try hard to stay away from that subject at work/etc
- i'm completely unable to game others
	- nor do i want to
	- not able to spark conversations to make people seem that i like them
		- i would be a terrible salesman
	- not able to break people down to a formula
		- in game theory, it is critical to know how your opponent will react
		- only after knowing this, can you plan and effective strategy
	- not able to construct tests for people's behavior, morals or beliefs
		- some people will try to test you with certain things to get to know you
		- testing others is very important bc it allows you to know how far you can trust people
		- even though i think testing people is superficial and shows a lack of trust
	- i don't try to gain others' trust or approval
		- because i just don't really care what other people thing (usually)

at work:
- i've been given fool's errands (especially at CCS)
	- one guy literally asked me "if i knew what the key to the midway was"
	- some of these fools errands were "impossible" problems
		- they thought i could not solve, because i didn't have a college degree
		- and they ended up backfiring because i excelled
	- sometimes i didn't take the fools errand
		- bc i had experienced it before
		- and because i was smart enough to see it for what it was
		- or because i started asking my managers about it
- i'm terrible at office politics
	- don't form "alliances"
	- i don't know what to do when i see people politicking
	- i don't want to partake in politicking because
		- i think it's wrong and
		- i see it as superficial
- i don't form relationships with the people i work with
	- sometimes this is because i'm afraid marijuana use will be turned against me later on
		- and it has, even though people were "cool" for months/years
	- it's partially bc i'm just not interested in peoples lives
		- married people with kids
		- stories about those kids
		- not interested in their hobbies
	- and i don't mean to seem like i'm completely uninterested
		- it's just so hard for me to relate, that i dont
	- and it's partially because i just have so much going on in my spare time
		- i don't feel like just hanging out at the bar with people from work
		- because i hate hanging out at bars and drinking, it's stupid
		- and this seems to be the only thing people want to do
	- it's because i can't relate to them
		- and don't know what to say in certain situations
		- so i'd rather say nothing, than be perceived as weak in a certain area
	- then when people start bullying me
		- i don't have too many people willing to stand up for me
		- it's not because they don't like me
		- it's because i haven't done anything for them
- i only talk about work at work
	- this is terrible because people want to escape that
	- they want to have fun while they work
- i'm only interested in ways to improve things
	- and this implicitly insults others' work
	- though i don't mean it that way
- i only talk to people when i need things
	- i don't mean to come off as if i'm using people, but that's what it seems like sometimes
- when i'm gamed by particularly manipulative people at work
	- my response so far has been to try to ignore them as much as possible
	- but just ignoring them is bad because then they just "ally" themselves with everyone else
	- and this isolates me even more

bully's at work:
- I WISH PEOPLE WOULD LISTEN TO ME ABOUT THIS
	- stop telling me its just the way the world is
	- stop telling me i just have to deal with it
	- because i can't just deal with it like other people
	- understand that this is the reason i'm afraid to get a job
- people with aspergers typically have problems with people at work
	- there are entire websites dedicated to this subject
	- people with aspergers are weak fish
	- and bullys at work try to pick these people out and show they are "weak"
	- so that when the layoffs come around
		- they are perceived as being higher on the totem pole
- at CCS, it was Richard
	- he constantly berated me in front of other people
	- when not in front of others
		- he superficially tried to gain my trust
			- very "glib" and "charming" (i guess)
			- tried to convince me that he was 'cool' with marijuana
				- so he had dirt on me when he needed it
				- but later told me how much he hated drugs
			- i felt him trying to form a superficial relationship with me
				- i felt him feeling for the soft spots on my back
				- the spots he'd use to stab me in the back later
	- when in front of others
		- he carried on conversations with me, as if he was speaking to everyone else in the room
		- constantly trying to find faults in things that i did
			- like when i fumbled over my words
		- and exaggerate them to other people
	- richard was originally hired as an hourly employe
		- literally to test him out (i believe because of past work history)
		- so he had an incentive to find others to get rid of
		- so that he could "take their place" and earn full time status
		- he was very self-conscious of the fact that he was hourly
	- he was not a good programmer at all
		- i felt bad for him when we paired up
		- he asked really dumb questions
		- and wasn't able to think ahead or make insights into the code
	- he lacked empathy and said some really messed up things to other people
		- he would say things about coworkers' relationships with their wives
		- hard for me to think of other specific examples here
	- he was very indirect about things when gaming people
		- you could never call him out on it
		- he never seemed like the bad guy
		- it was pointless to try to stand up for him
			- he'd make you look like the bad guy anyways
			- he'd simply start focusing his attention on you more and more
	- he waited until my last day to tell me "what he really thought" (and i knew he would)
		- that if i stopped acting like a kid, people would stop treating me like one
	- i left work CRYING on multiple occasions
	- one person at CCS left to join the "Workplace Bullying Institute" (not kidding)
- at Enable Labs, it was Jim Cifarelli
	- this guy just seemed creepy
	- again, he was very indirect about things
		- never seemed like the bad guy
	- he was good at NLP (neuro-linguistic programming)
		- although he'd never admit it
		- NLP is the ability to do things a certain way to override people's logic
			- phrasing things a certain way
			- using certain words to create associations in peoples' minds
			- there's a lot of BS about it on the internet, but some of it works
	- he seemed to notice that if he started moving his hands after asking me a question
		- that i would not be able to think as well
		- and that'd i'd fumble over my words
		- so he took my sensory overload and used it against me
		- he seemed to know ALOT about psychology
	- i just tried to be nice to him
		- tried to be very tactful about things
		- but this is difficult and takes a lot of effort
	- he tried to lead me down rabbit holes in projects
		- because of my experiences at CCS, i saw it coming
		- and because of reading "the 48 laws of power", i saw the games
		- and it turned out that they have a copy of that book at enable
		- and i very clearly saw some of them trying to use some of these tactics
		- call me paranoid if you want, whatever.
	- there was a highly polarized political situation here
		- EL was contracting on a project that wasn't going well
		- IMNinjas was my company and we had invested 500,000 in the project so far
		- I was a new guy and dumb enough and waltz in and say they were going about things wrong
		- Jim had been specially pointed out to me as difficult to work with			- everything was very tense there
	- one thing he did was to draw me out into "explaining things"
		- he was very very good at "playing dumb"
		- he was draw me out into explaining an idea
		- then he would claim he didn't understand it
			- thereby trivializing my ideas
	- he would converse in such a way that never allowed me to gain any ground
		- no matter what my argument, he ignored it
		- his choice of words and reactions reduced others' confidence in me
		- and these are conversations that others are only half listening to
		- so it's easy for others to comprehend the criticisms
			- but unless they are completely following the conversation
			- they will not listen to the complicated technical arguments
	- later on, there was a mini conference,
		- where i talked for an hour on a gem that i wrote
		- jim was "very interested" and wanted to video tape it…
			- he was hoping i'd get up there just to crash and burn
			- and that he'd have it on video
		- he butchered the camera job
		- when i actually did OK and spoke for the entire hour
			- he tried to convince me to delete the video
			- and after he gave the file to me, he did delete it
			- at which point the guy running the conference wanted it back
			- when i watched it, i thought i actually did ok
		- he claimed that he still "didn't understand it"
			- and if he didn't he was either dumb or playing dumb
			- thus trivializing what i considered an accomplishment
	- he would try to draw me out into political discussions
		- one time while we were heading to a meet up
		- he decided to play sean hannity radio
		- even though i already know he was very liberal
		- when we got there, he acted like it was my idea (other people there are very liberal)
			- and acted like he didn't have anything to do with it
		- it was up to me to stand up and correct this
			- it's an example of a COMPLETELY INVALID perception he tried to set
		- he was talking to another very liberal person
			- why would he even bring this up or do this at all?
		- when it comes to office politics
			- real politics can be some of the most decisive topics
			- you live, you learn
	- very early on he (and others) would publicly test my knowledge
		- in an effort to discredit me (because of my CCNA and SQL certifications)
		- he thought he would be able to call me out and show that i didn't know what i was talking about
	- at enable labs, they tried very hard
		- to control who and what i worked on
	- i later did some contracting for them
		- and worked in a room completely separate from jim
		- got along with everyone just fine
- both times, i was gamed into making mistakes and making enemies
	- made to feel useless and stupid
	- demoralized into giving up
	- my suggestions marginalized and trivialized
- both times, they attempted to create perceptions in the minds of the people around me
	- that i wasn't smart
	- that my ideas weren't dangerous
	- that my ideas weren't useful
- both times, they tried very hard to control what i was working on
	- to ensure that i did not appear to contribute to anything useful
	- sometimes they would give me things that were "way beyond my skills"
		- and they weren't of course, this always backfired
- I never had problems with anyone at ABS
	- though there were some politics towards the end
	- and i think some of the other older employees there were jealous of my salary
		- i left out paystubs because i didn't think to hide them

==========

Whether or not you have aspergers, it seems to me, from what I
searched on the Internet, that you are going to have to try and try
again.  With or without aspergers, the amount of time and effort you
are spending on getting a job is not enough.  It feels as though your
fear of getting a job is lending you a quasi-vacation, limited only to
getting a couple bucks for this or that.  You need to understand that
the rest of us have about 1-2 hours of free time each day plus maybe a
day of 3-4 hours on a day off work.

I have said this before, but I wanted it too go into this email, so
that you and others, can comment on it: (Space below for comment)

We have a money problem.  Emotional support is easy.  We all have
known each other for most or all of our grown lives.  We are family (I
am considering Perry family here) and we love each other.
Conversations, where money is not present, are usually enjoyable, even
though we sometimes disagree.  Our relationships are stronger than
most of the relationships that we with have with other people, because
we are family.  The ugly conversations that I have noticed start with
either a ride or a meal or coffee or just a couple bucks for this or
that.  We do not need permission from anyone to eat, drink or be
merry.  BUT YOU DO NEED MONEY for each one.  This is why I keep saying
your problems are STRICKLY money problems.  Recent arguments would not
have taken place at all, if you had no debts and a regular source of
money.  Imagine, no arguments with mom or any of us, just the
emotional support that you, and all of us, require.

===========

So, it seems to me, that all discussion should be focused on:

1. Finding out your aspergers status (and I mean immediately, like you
   are on fire, and the only thing that puts the fire out is the
   diagnosis, like as in what are you doing tomorrow, and the next day
   and the next day, persistent until the final word is in)

2. Getting a source of income immediately, and a game plan for income
   in the future.  If aspergers, should we consider social security?
   http://www.disabilitysecrets.com/conditions-page-1-16.html


With or without aspergers, I sympathize with your current situation.
I want to see you break free, and, please do not underestimate the
power of prayer, even if it starts off as a futile (but serious)
exercise.

Love, Everyone's favorite sibling, child, parent, friend,

Chris "its hard to be humble when your this awesome" Conner

(It was just getting too serious)
