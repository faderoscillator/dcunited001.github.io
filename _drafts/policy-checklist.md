================================

### general objectives for every policy in the next decade

1. Does this help end poverty?
  - does this minimize specific causes of poverty?
  - does it provide opportunity?
2. Does it strengthen the middle class?
  - instability in the middle class leads to mortages that can't be
    paid, etc, etc. in addition to wealth distribution, this indicates
    economic turbulance
3. Does it anticipate our economy's direction in 5/10 years?
  - and/or does this policy help us foresee where tech is taking us?
  - does the policy help us train the skills we need a decade from
    now?
  - infrastructure investments are a great idea, but we need to be
    aware that new manufacturing techniques and materials will be
    available soon.  we have to start now, so we can't wait, but we
    should be aware of that.
4. Does it promote America's pursuit of happiness?
  - can be rephrased as: how can we make our business, government,
    private and family services more efficient, so that americans can
    focus on the things that matter?
  - Does it help people lead fulfilling lives? Or spend more time with
    their family?
  - Or does it mean that people have to wade through beaurocracy to
    function?
5. Does it strengthen our culture?
  - Does this lead to greater awareness for important issues?
  - Does it help us teach the next generation to teach the values we
    wish were second nature when we were growing up?
  - Does it encourage people to get involved in their community?
  - Does it help promote community activity?
6. How does this policy help bridge the gap for the developing world?
  - How can we extend the opportunities we have here to other
    countries?  (in a way that makes sense for american interests)
    - this is a great tool for leverage in foreign policy (i think)
    - though it's a bit unwieldy
7. Does it provide/promote economic opportunity?
  - How so? Does it provide tax-funded jobs?
8. Does it cause unintended consequences for the economy?
  - how does it affect the operation of private businesses?
  - Does it supplant services provided by private businesses?
9. How does this policy affect medical care of americans?
  - Does this policy lead to lower cost/price of medical care?
  - How does it affect their quality of care and choices?
10. How does the policy affect small businesses in america?
  - small business is really one of the most important factors
    promoting the middle class. wealth spread throughout small
    business means that ownership over american enterprise is spread
    over many households
11. Does it promote or detract from national security?
12. How does it affect how we position ourselves and how we project
    our image to the world?
13. How does it affect foreign policy?
  - Flexibility in foreign policy? Capacity to exert leverage?
14. Does it allow us to maintain a strong military?
15. Is it part of a unified, coherent policy?
  - does the left hand know what the right hand is doing?

================================

to respond/clarify:

- health care
- education
  - need to elaborate. big ideas are mostly lofty imagery
  - need to specify what i mean
- immigration
  - how can i @!#$'ing clarify this any more?
  - i wrote 10,000 words on this
  - building a wall (we have to stop the influx of illegal
    immigration)
    - if we don't slow/stop it, the problem is going to be much bigger
      later on.
- real social change.
  - real upward motion from impovershed demographics
  - powered by social/cultural changes & education
- religious freedom
  - religion/education via vouchers
    - how to structure fair policies legally
- stance on trade

- who are these ppl?

================================

(on hillary) i mean i'd feel badly for anyone in that position,
regardless of what they did and especially in contrast to how they act
about what they did. it's not as easy to understand people as it seems
and if they can't assess their own relationships with others honestly,
then it's almost more sad. this entire thing is sooo fucked up

Vote for the best candidate. To me, your vote isn't as important as
why you cast the vote you did. And in our elections, that reasoning
and being vocal about it has the potential for more effect than any
vote or financial contribution ever could. It's that simple.

#Trump is breaking out the Big Tent again. and we're going to unify
America so we can make progress in the world

but we actually need fiscal conservatism, combined with social
liberalism (with the ability forsmall communities to structure their
lives according to religious freedom while respecting the lives/views
of individuals) if we can do that, while unifying America and
retaining a strong military, we're going to be just fine

================================

Brief quotes from RNC speeches:

- we are stronger through the colors that unite us
- all lies matter .... (on second thought...)
- more than ever, we are dedicated to solving these problems
  *together*.
- Reagan's 80% Quote
  - Reagan's Status Quo Quote
- "What you are speaks so loudly that i can not hear a word you're
  saying"




=============


#### difference b/w RNC & DNC:

one couldn't wait for the country to see them for what they truly
were. The other has to make it through the next week frantic the
country might see them for what they are.

Regardless of what each says about the other, which one would you
prefer to lead? The one who's proud to show you who they truly are,
even when that means showing their flaws. or handling the perceived
flaws from unfair press coverage.

================================

## CSPAN2 show on presidential transitions:

on transitions & filling policy positions:

- christopher lu
  - former executive director of obama-biden transition project
  - "the vast majority of what happens in government isn't partisan"
    - this quote underscores my notes about cooperation below
    - "you really just want it to work"
      - you debate on the changes you want, but rule of law and
        efficiency/efficacy of policy takes precidence

- "people are policy"
- "all generalizatoins are false, including this one"
- "... because they don't govern with ... "
  - goals need to be outcome-oriented
    - goals are good, but can be restraining
    - e.g. over-promise and now you're strained in several directions
  - it's harder to govern if you have very *specific* goals
    - because if they are specific, you aren't willing to be
  - while transparency is good, sometimes this can make things
    difficult. if you reveal everything you want to do to people

###


- speech - start out with a list of goals to say you'll be accountable
  for achieving by the end of your term
  - put a man on the moon by the end of the decade - JFK
  - goals should be emotionally stirring and motivate people inside
    and outside your movement

- the bar has always been set high for previous transitions
  - the obama administration held the bush administration to

- career staff and political staff
  - ... ? what are these?
  - "careers" are highly motivated to do a good job to impress
    superiors
    - these people are motivated by success in their career
  - political staff - i think moreso is the campaign staff
    - nope, not really


- there's a process for the administration, but then there's also a
  protracted process from the appointee's point of view
  - especially for those who must be confirmed by congress
  - they might need to shuffle around their life just to pursue a
    nomination
    - for example, dept of labor appointee nominee had to divest his
      entire stock portfolio because dept of labor works with
      everything


- there is a transition period
- australia has 8 roles that change when there's a new administration
  - with the US, there are thousands
    - senate must confirm hundreds of them

### Questions

- what exactly does the transition staff do?
  - do both candidates for an executive position like the president
    have their own transition teams while evaluating who they want
    in the cabinet?
  - or would they have a small transition team early on before the
    election results, ramping up as election day approaches?

  - this implies that the transition staff should have access to
    information about what's going on and the kinds of challenges the
    country might face in the next several years.

- what do agency review teams do during the transition?
  - ... besides the obvious
- what are the differences b/w the campaign staff?
  - this team needs to be soley focused on your campaign because if
    you don't win, it doesn't matter
  - and transition... ?
  -


- when the administration changes parties, this prevents significantly
  more challenges than it would otherwise
  - but it's also a good way to observe how loyal/ethical people are
    going to be when they are working across the aisle.
    - obviously, in politics, people are used to working with others
      who have opposing viewpoints.

- "it helps to have people move around the government/washington"
  - this can give people a better perspective

- deputy directors are similar to COO's


- "labor is about peace and prosperity"

I'm mostly saving this content bc it's my responses to how democrats
might respond to my own arguments. so i want to be able to connect
with them in a way that responds to the actual domestic/foreign policy
concerns they have.

from my discussion with Nathan on this [facebook
post](https://www.facebook.com/dconner.pro/posts/10204286769886056)

> “Human beings are naturally social creatures. We live in close
> proximity to other humans in order to receive a degree of protection
> from nature, and other humans who would do us harm."

this is why the intentional sociophysical isolation of political
dissidents with fictitious mental illness is sickening. it appears
obama began to blend national security, preventative mental health and
health “care” to suppress dissidents.

> “According to John Locke’s Social Contract Theory…”

yes i agree with this paragraph, however, it still doesn’t explain why
both the left and the right have been raping the american public
without explanation via surveillance and the “national security”
apparatus for the better part of two decades.

i’m smart enough to fear the poor. they always have the upper hand
when it comes to numbers. that’s been true since the dawn of human
civilization.

> “I don’t want to reduce everyone to being dependent on government
> for everything.”

this is how i understand the intent behind your political
sentiments. however, i don’t think you understand what has happened to
my life and many others just like me over the past ten years.

> “Where it is reasonable, efforts should be made to make public
> transportation, and socialization opportunities available for
> everyone.”

yes, especially to the last one. people should NOT be sociophysically
isolated. it makes almost every conceivable psychological,
sociological or financial problem orders of magnitude worse than it
needs to b.

> “But I still maintain that everyone does not have equal
> opportunities.”

I agree, but this means we need to be careful about how we look at
statistics, especially statistics with ethnicity involved. for
example, when looking at statistics for poverty or arrests, the
long-term trends should be taken into account: is the long-term trend
moving towards actual equality at an acceptable rate? this is what
should be happening. if it’s not, then the interpersonal relationships
of those communitis may need to be assessed to gain more insight into
why it’s not happening. while the statistics in Ferguson were
atrocious, i feel like people are jumping to rash conclusions in other
circumstances/

> “But other sustainable pathways out of poverty need to be available
> for people of every ability level.”

the fundamental problem is not whether this is right or wrong, but
whether the solutions are economically sustainable. tragically, i do
not think that there are any sustainable economic solutions to poverty
because of technology. so, while technology will improve the lives of
the poor, automation will disrupt society and people will become
dependent on government assistance, which is NOT economically
sustainable because it’s derived from taxes revenues. those tax
revenues only exist in high volume where you have profitable
industry. UBI will inevitably cause leaders on the left AND the right
to begin to view the human life with contempt. as this happens, the
common person will also become contemptuous of their life’s value,
cynical of their surroundings, depressed at the rampant nihilism that
completely disregards their circumstance and eventually hopeless.

your statements are sensible, assuming that life and the economy
will continue to unfold as it has in the 2010’s. unfortunately, i do
not believe that it will, but i’m overly cynical and pessimistic.

# Misc Political Ideas

- tax credits for demostrated linguistic fluency?
  - not likely to work, unfortunately
  - i think the free market would be a more effective mechanism for
    rewarding those who learn additional languages.
    - the free market would already remunerate you for learning
      languages with poor knowledge distribution in the united states
      - i.e. langauges like Arabic, Russian or Swahili
