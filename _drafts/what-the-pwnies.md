#### imagined getting detained by these brownie soul-sucker time
vampire shitheads, telling you to hang yourself like the mac ponie

![Definition of a Brownie]()

- yeh ... apparently, i let myself get emasculated by brownies. i'm
  still wondering what psychological shit they endured to become
  sexually attracted to cartoon horses ... which is apparently a
  common factor here: it's like a collosuem for psychological torture
  and all the people who do shit to you have been victimized
  themselves, too. This is hilarious if you think about it because it
  means that, if you haven't quite woken up to what's happening, then
  the people who are hurting you probably had their boards broken a
  bit faster than you.
  - one of them even acted like he was "my handler" -- he said that
    word verbatim to gain my trust. your my gaurd you hairy piece of
    shit.
  - and [here's the key]

### [What The Pwnies?!](#what-the-pwnies)

If you wanted to correct a problem, you would give someone the chance
to say something about it -- e.g. one on one; mono e mono; a fucking
conversation. If you wanted to create problems, so you can pretend
your fear of "Nazi's riding dinosaurs" is justified, then you would do
exactly what has been done. You needed to create the enemy because the
enemy was not actually there. Further, you needed to overcome hurdles
imposed by your *political rivals* pushing back in a democracy against
expensive liberal policies which were required.

All your babes are belong to us, for "experiments" of course. It
serves you right, doesn't it? And if you really believed in what you
did, you wouldn't said a word about it would you? See? The explanation
checks an awful lot of boxes, although it really has zero factual
basis. You'll have all the papers you need, no one will be able to
tell the difference. And NO, you'll children nor your children's
children will EVER be permitted to have anything of significance, nor
will anyone be the wiser as to why so many of their lives are
miserable.

### ["La démocratie" -- c'est une idée ironique, n'est-ce pas?](#la-democratie-cest-une-idee-ironique)

By the way, the 51st state is not going to be Puerto Rico. It was
never even up for debate -- well, technically it was. That's what the
Deep State does: they control everything. Everything is and, since
WW2, as always been a very complicated facade, albeit a democracy --
*TECHNICALLY*. It's that way, for a reason: because it's probably best
that the masses don't drag us down to economic collapse and thence
rears that damnably invulnerable hydra communism.

The point is not that democracy is inherently flawed. Instead the
point is that democracy without free press where unchecked
disinformation floods minds with fervorous rancor isn't democracy at
all. It's simply a facade, which actually serves the interests of the
elite more often than it protects the interests of the
people.

Basically, I'm saying -- want a democracy? **GO TO SCHOOL, PROTECT
WHISTLEBLOWERS AND MAKE SURE CNN DOESN'T RUN THE SHOW**. But when you
don't do that, the economy will destabalize. What results is a descent
into ignorance, poverty and leninism -- which is one fantastic reason
the American's kept the Nazi's on such a short leash for all this
time, as long as those ignorant Nazi shits can keep their racism in
check. Why is it fantastic? Because if there's one thing Nazi's hate
more than anything else, it's communists.

That's our ace in the hole, in case Communism is released in
America. The only reason that would even happen is if the Federal
Reserve can't keep their shit under control.

Guess who has all the legal keys to this, by the way. It's Donald
J. Trump. His family is connected to all of it and that's partially
what the Anna Nicole Smith case was about: could any of their seized
property even incidentally fall outside the strict control of
[OAPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Alien_Property_Custodian).

And if I ain't Trump's uncle -- his uncle was the Alien Property
Custodian! And now you know what all of this shit is *potentially*
about, by the way. It's about *domineering* the historical narrative
of post-WW2 history, for whatever reason. I can't actually say.

Anyways, no, we do not actually want Nazi's riding on dinosaurs, but
if I had to choose between diversity-rainbow "not-Nazi's" on ponies
using civic nationalism in America and this chaotic Leninist
engineered collapse that will damn america's economy for a century,
leaving the singularity squarely in the hands of those Goddamn
sychophantic leninists, I would choose the Mu "not-nazi's" in less
time than it takes my heart to beat one more time. And is it racist?
*HELL NO, YOU DUMB MOTHERFUCKERS. THIS IS ABOUT AMERICA.*

#### One Such Diversity Rainbow Not-Nazi The Leninists Just Wouldn't Let You See, So You Couldn't Stop the Inevitable Collapse

![WHAT THE PWNIES?!!]()

What the fuck was that fetus thing anyways? Have you ever horizontally
flipped the "Coon and Friends" Logo? Fuck those assholes. You want an
economy? You want prosperity where America's collective, multi-ethnic
fate is NOT determined by our enemies? Do you remember how
anti-American their narratives are? *YOU WANT THAT TO BE YOUR
FUTURE?!* Really? **That** shit is *cray*.

Anyways, there it all is. I've written it down. I am not racist. I
never was. If my entire life from conception was a protest, the point
is => *I'M NOT FUCKING RACIST*. That's the point. I don't understand
what this is about. I don't know why I've been targeted. It may be
because I figured some BYMAN shit out around the end of 2012. If I
ever had some connection to this, I wouldn't know. That seems crazy,
to me. Impossible. I'm already crazy enough: do I need another
delusion. Would you like to gaslight me some more?  Because I know how
to handle that. Jujutsu. If it ain't true, by the time you finish
gaslighting me with delusional bullshit, people are going to believe
it's true: people other than me because I ain't stupid.


**Pick one:** either something like the Project for a New American
Century successfully guarantees that we hang on to power ... or there
is systemic economic collapse that degrades into *IRONIC COMMUNISM*,
the very worst type of the worst form of government. Either one, can
we please not become a giant nation of racist assholes? Because
diversity really is America's greatest strength in a 21st century
economy by the way.

There are such things as sociopolitical and socioeconomic competition
and America has to compete, just like everyone else. When you allow
foreign influences to convince us to take it easy, corrupt our youth
or generally demoralize the population, you cripple America's ability
to compete. That's NOT racist. That is reality. The world is pretty
tough place and it can be dark. America is not alone. Even though
we've become weak after a generation of unchallenged monopolar
hegemony, our position in the world is not guaranteed.

Neither are the moral requirements for running the world's reserve
currency, nor are the fiscal advantages derived thereof. By the way,
communism guarantees losing Dollar's world reserve currency, even
though we have do options, though we do not actually want to exercise
many of those.

Leninists will try to argue up and down about that, by the way, but at
this point, do you trust any of them? They're going to lie about
everything, then tell their own story when once they gain
control. Then, they'll associate anyone who disagrees with them with
their enemies. That's what they do. Every time.

Most critically, these "revolutionaries" have less than a single
generation of leadership under their belt. At the most competitive
point in history, do you really want them to take control? They have
no vision. Their idea of "success" involves collapsing the economy,
painting all dissidents with a broad brush and fabricating all of
these counter-narratives moving foward whereby they can count on using
them in the future. This is all while they idiotically **hope** that
*America's most powerful former adversaries are nice to us* in the
ensuing power vaccum that determines geopolitics in the Western
Hemisphere. This is all while those foreign adversaries help those in
"power" in the United Soviet States of Formerly America mercilessly
hunt down all *potential* political dissidents, like Stalinists are
wont to do.

Imagine that America falls. What does this mean for good 'ole Nerf'd
NATO, whose european militaries EU countries won't even finance.
Really? This all sounds like a no-brainer for who? *AND I AM THE ONE
BEING CENSURED HERE*? Wut election?

When all that is said and done, is it really such a hard choice, if it
can be guaranteed that there is no racism?
