## Quantum Language

In an earlier article,
[The Nature of Space, Time and Information Implies Universal Language](http://te.xel.io/posts/2016-04-12-the-nature-of-space-time-and-information-implies-universal-language.html),
I posited the possibility of a quantum language. Such a language would
extend the concept of the singular universal language developed by any
sufficiently advanced intelligent life in the universe. Such a
universal language results from several factors, including the
possibility of one way communication across the universe without the
need to exchange grammar and semantics or any information to receive,
transmit and consume. These would instead be implicit and all of it
would be extrapolated from symmetry inherent in some root
mathematic concepts.  This would expand to encompass all possible
concepts that any life form would signify. It is hard to imagine what
that universal language would look like, but if it sounds interesting,
give the article a read...

The representations of information in QS, UQS and quantum circuits are
to one's and zero's what the quantum universal language would be to
ASCII. The quantum language would not encode textual representations
of words.  For that matter, such a language would never actually have
discretely signalled structure, which is partly why it's such an
interesting thought experiment.

What do I think this language would be like? I don't know enough about
quantum circuits to provide anything more than sci-fi speculation.
Perhaps it's like whalesong emitted between alien superintelligences
separated by vast distances.  Imagining this concept might be a futile
pursuit of imagination.

However, if intelligent life evolves to utilize quantum across the
board, it probably removes the digital/quantum divide in hardware and
networking. For example, stepping down to digital representations of
information may present a hardware or process bottleneck. If most or
all algorithms can be represented or structured entirely within
quantum circuits, then there would be acceptably minimal design
limitations for software.

Assuming all computation and networking is quantum, then for
information to convey meaning via the universal language referenced
above, the grammar and meaning needs to be composed into the
non-deterministic state of quantum circuit components.

# FOR ALL SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED INTELLIGENT LIFEFORMS

## It Is Predetermined That Universal Language Convers Economic & Ecologic Benefits Via Reduced Computational/Spatial Complexity

- Leibniz's Characteristica Universalis: it's predtermined that, to
  address computational/spatial complexity issues, we must also design
  a new language AS DOES EVERY SIGNIFICANTLY ADVANCED CIVILIZATION
  - this need would occur as a civilization approaches the singularity

  - as i've described before, this language would redesign culture and
    communication around metaphysical/mathematic primatives
    - progress towards a semantic graph for the language can proceed
      by intermeshing the semantic graphs of existing human language,
      followed by recursive resolution of the dissonance between them.
      - where the language pairs each exhibit regions that are both
        locally dense or locally sparse, they share similarity in
        structure (in overly simplistic terms)
        - in this way: they are "in phase"
        - they could also be "out of phase" if a language pair's
          graphs regions are dense on one graph and sparse on another
        - this is much easier to understand with a picture (included
          on the first post i wrote on this)
          - i now understand many better ways of comparing the
            semantic graphs of languages.
    - however, since there are many concepts that humanity as a whole
      has yet to understand, this process only gives us an idea of the
      "direction" towards the universal semantic/semiotic graph
      - the overall final structure would be infinite and incredibly
        complex. it should map to the idea of "the one is the all and
        the all is the one"
      - it should also map to math fundamentals

## It Is Predetermined for the Occult to Escape Like Fire

- another near-certainty: it is predetermined that knowledge of the
  occult would spread accrose the world like fire as a civilization
  approaches the singularity.
  - this is because of the need/convergence of telecom, the desire for
    power, control over resource distribution and social hierarchies
    - as population grows, so does mankind's sociophysical potential
      energy. control more people and lense the result of their
      sociophysical energy
    - eventually, telecom provides infrastructure for information
      distribution. better information, better distribution
  - even without understanding the technological specifics of telecom,
    this fear of the virulent escape of the occult is potentially
    knowable via postulates of social physics (as are other
    extrapolated phenomena)
    - basically, as population density increases on a sphere with
      limited area, then so does the creation, speciation, exchange
      and speed of propagation for information.
    - therefore, given the evolutionary dynamics of information, then
      as population grows, so does the creation/exchange of invention
      and innovation.
  - if you want to influence social hierarchies, commerce and
    communication knowledge of the occult is invaluable. it has been
    tightly controlled throughout history, but it's just information.
    - given the following:
      - (1) population grows exponentially
      - (2) increasing population density yields both more tightly
        connected networks and increased profit volume from commerce
    - then the exponential increase in connectivity (combined with the
      potential for faster communication/commerce feedback loops, like
      telecom, navigation or steam engines)
      - implies that the potential for some knowledge to escape
        increases without some mechanisms to keep it in check

## When the Occult Spreads Virally, Linguistic and Semioteleological Aspects of Culture Distribute Themselves Across Society

- however, if the knowledge for the occult escapes, then people may
  identify pattern languages and other information, especially that
  whose knowledge was prefered to be minimal
  - when this happens, it results in the need for a new linguistic
    basis for what are the same semioteleological mappings
  - this has happened before, though it was almost always
    unintentional. either:
    - shifting sociopolitical centers of power root themselves some
      place where the langauge doesn't adequately reinforce the
      ability for the powerful to control people via subtleties of
      communication
    - or wars, cultural flux and linguistic drift led to the mixture
      of langauges that slowly invalidated/disrupted the elite's grasp
      over communication via nuance (word clearing)
    - linguistic evolution reinforces/disrupts:
      - interpersonal communication (by harmonizing subtleties and
        nuace of dialect/language) at the micro-level
      - sociopolitical churn (all the way up to the macro level)
  - this has happened before: the Romans push into the Brittish Isles
    and suddenly the people are incentivized to develop a subtle
    understanding of Latin and all the nuance of Roman culture
    - by doing this you can leverage commerce/connection to cooperate
      OR disrupt
    - something like this also occured when the William the Conqueror
      invaded England, mixing Latin, French and Anglo-Saxon linguistic
      components into
      - this created a state of linguistic chaos, where people were
        free to pick and choose from whatever word roots they felt
        were advantageous.
        - during these periods, "micro-environments" that facilitate
          linguistic evolution develop in locally connected regions
        - this means people can restructure language however they
          please.
        - in this chaotic period of evolution, cryptolects and argots
          develop, but these are like Web Applications in that their
          utility borrows heavily from the network effect: only when
          the argot or slang is widespread is it useful.
          - counterintuitively, when slang becomes too widespread, it
            loses its value for signaling

## Adjourning Artificial Intelligence With Efficient Universal Language

- the concept/need for a new language modeled on:
  - (1) Leibniz' Characteristica Universalis & math primitives
  - (2) Cultural Universals
  - (3) teleology and semiotics
  - this language helps address the dangers of AI that stem from a
    compulsion to minimize energy consumption
    - viz. the fear that AI might destroy all humans because we're too
      energetically inefficient
    - instead, this universal language helps us "pre-compress" all the
      artifacts of communication related to human culture and
      experience
      - further, this may make it easier to compute with the content
        buried in voice/text/etc
        - the CCG grammar trees could be constructed/parsed more
          efficiently, with less ambiguity, etc
        - the semantic concepts could be more certainly mapped AND
          universally compared WITHOUT PARITY LOSS at most stages in
          data processing
  - but some subtleties of the language implementation and migration
    imply that it may not provide enough value to offset its costs
    - further, networks of people specifically deviate from the norms
      for language use in their region so that they *aren't*
      understood in some cases.
      - langauge derives its utility from the network effect, but a
        society with a single language offers a major incentive for
        competition (i.e. the Tower of Babel)
      - therefore, human susceptibility to power dynamics imply the
        need for a creative solution -- two languages:
        - the universal language as the lingua franca
        - and a vulgate (or regional languages)
    - there is interesting dissonance/synergy between English and
      Japanese/Chinese
