Systems Theory is all about feedback loops. It's a powerful, but
simple science of modeling processes with feedback loops... basically.
If you know a lot about Systems theory... (you'll know i have almost
zero knowledge in this subject)
...

to model processes In business, you'll need to know a bit
of systems theory to design logistics, reporting, robust inventory and
processes. Thanks PersonalMBA... That's if you are

- the ability to create the truth moving forward confers great power


The measure of a good man is what he decides to do when a friend needs
help, whether his friend asks directly or not. When it’s not his
problem and especially when he’ll incur significant retribution for
helping his friend or especially a stranger! Even moreso when it’s a
stranger!

### Integrity: I Have It, Almost to a Fault

When someone cares more about about truth, justice, compassion,
equity, integrity and virtue than their own life? That’s a good
person! This is what you should look for in man! Reward their ability
to make personal sacrifice for justice, love and truth!

And, off-topic, that’s what makes military and police good people in
general. This is why, even though I’ve found myself arrested and
singled out for drug charges, I can’t look at an officer or a soldier
without respect. It’s because I know that ninety-nine times out of a
hundred, or really more than that, the person wearing that uniform is
willing to risk their life. The reason they do is because they care so
much about the kinds of things people should care about, that they are
willing to risk their life for it.

# What Kind of Person Are You?

### Attributes?

Are you intelligent? Smart? Hardworking? Are you trustworthy? Loud?
Well-known? Well-respected? Resourceful?

### Motivation?

What motivates you? How easily can you be persuaded to want something
else? Are you easily controlled through fear? Are you fickle,
superficial or materialistic? Can you be persuaded through your
desires? Can you be bought? Coerced? Could you be goaded into action?
Or easily led around by the nose?

### Ethics?

Do you have a strong sense of your own ethics? Is it well-defined?
Deeply thought out? Experienced? Practical? Are you open-minded to
other frameworks? Do you project that sense of ethics to others around
you?  With just your words or with your actions too? What do you do
when you see others violate your ethics? And their own? Do you
volunteer and try to serve others?

###

(title: "self-fixedness", "self-constant-ness")

What do you do when no one is looking? When you think no one's looking
or when you *know* know one is looking? What's the difference? If
everyone could see everything you've done for years at a time
... every word, thought and visible action, what would they think?
Everyone has faults, but people who live their life as though there
really might be judgement for their actions regardless of their
visibility seem to be stronger & more resilient. They can't cheat
themselves out of working harder by simply lying, taking or pulling
one over on someone else. It requires the development of complicated
behaviors regardless: either the foresight to structure one's actions
morally or the insight and instinct to flow between the awareness of
others.  (And the latter is not usually a good feeling by the way)

It's an interesting question because we'll soon be moving towards a
world like that, whether we like it or not. It will be impossible to
do much anything without some level of visibility, whether we like it
or not. Would that visibility change your statements and actions? What
kind of person would simply be themselves regardless? Does your
perception of your own beliefs change when you think no one is
looking? Who would even want to become aware of that? How does your
perception of yourself change in response to the degree of visibility
and your degree of awareness of visibility? What if you're wrong and
everything is visible? And what if everything always has been visible?
What changes? Why?

### Integrity

## Modeling Casual Human Behavior

### actions speak louder than words

#### actions are basically really loud words

#### reactions are crystal clear

well.... maybe not exactly

### what are they not doing? not saying? not reacting to?

this is wayyy more useful than anything so far
- but the idea that people are chasing some sense of equilibrium
  models this domain much more robustly

#### how does change affect the situation

#### what is this person/people optimizing their behavior on

### How Might I Know That

## Facets of Greatness (what section?)

misc advice(but powerful): if you're not asking me what i want, how do
i know you're trying to help me?

- the more important point is: these people should know what you want
  and they should be good at ascertaining what you want without asking
  you.
  - yet, depending on your role in life and your psychologically
    ingrained need for control, you might make it difficult to get
    that information.
- if you don't ask for my needs, that's kind of a yellow card ... maybe
  - but if you don't care about what i want or you don't care about my
    needs
    - EVEN IF I'M IGNORANT OF THEM AND **ESPECIALLY** IF I'M CLUELESS
  - then you probably don't care as much as you should
- this is important when you're dealing with people that tell you what
  you want to hear or what they think you need to hear
  - because it's a metric that allows you to discern:
    - does this person care about my goals
    - or is this person capable of serving my needs?
    - if you can't understand what I need, then I can't depend on you!
  - keep in mind there are plenty of relationships where you should
    not stress this
    - because that person might not be obligated to do shit for you
    - or bc you might want relationships that are not based on someone
      needing to provide you with something
      - equally mutually beneficial relationships
    - however, if you have a lot of money/power, then these
      relationships can be risky, especially if you depend on them
      - because you can't control them
      - if this person is sheisty, then they might tug on the other
        end of that rope and, if you don't each need each other, then
        they might be able to throw you off balance a bit.

- If you're not asking me about what I want, what I need,
  - and i usually keep that close to my chest
  - then how would you know what I want, if I haven't told you?
- so if that's the case, then I already (and always will) know that
  you're either incompetent, careless, just fucking with me or trying
  to use me for something YOU want.
  - i'm not sure which one is worst.
- so if, through your words & actions, you don't give me a consistent
  impression that you need to know what i think, need and
  want
  - then you're inherently going to raise my suspicion
  - and if you give me the impression that you don't care what i want,
    that's almost worse
    - it's almost as someone who should know what you want, but
      interacting with them and trying to ascertain their perception
      of yours needs is like living out one of those paradoxical logic
      riddles
      - where there's two doors and one leads to certain death and the
        other leads to hot cosplayers
      - but you have like cunningly trick either person into telling
        you the truth.
        - that's bullshit
        - i don't actually want to think about it that hard
        - i just want to know
    - if someone is fucking with you this and then bitches about
      relationship problems, but consistent misleads you on what they
      want/need and their idea of what you want/need
      - THAT PERSON DOESN'T CARE!!
      - that person doesn't want to improve the relationship!
      - in fact, that's quite the opposite, they seem to be actively
        sabotaging the relationship and wasting your time.
    - and they're playing you for a fool
      - which means that they probably think you're stupid or they're
        really smart. either way, that's horse shit.
- you can lead, follow or get out of the way
  - or... you can help me, you can hinder me, or you can get out of
    the way.

### [Systems Theory - Structure the Incentives and Feedback Loops]()

- brief notes on how this approach to modeling allows you to construct
  systems which are viable and effective in almost any domain
  - business, government, etc
  - it's the intersection of systems theory (biology & business) with
    game theory
  - human and group interactions are all based on motivation, risk,
    reward, goals, feedback loops and communication.
    - and a tiered, multidimensional approach towards each of those

- the number one thing we can do is make sure that group incentives
  line up. this single point of information alone might be the most
  valuable nugget in this entire post.
  - make sure individuals and groups know what they want and make sure
    that the people on our side want the same time.
  - if they want something else, see if you can convince them that
    what you want is really the same thing

  - need to motivate the legal and illegal immigrant populations to
    action (need to elaborate more here)
    - consequences for illegal immigrants to cooperate can't all be
      negative.
    - seriously, what incentive would an illegal immigrant have for
      putting themselves at risk to cooperate with the system?
    - i don't really know what our options are here... but i'd love to
      explore them and hear what ideas people have

  - what I did here was explain how each class of citizens in america
    actually wants the same thing with regard to illegal
    immigration. even the illegal immigrants! We all want to be
    respected, hard-working citizens of America.
    - when you view these tough issues in that way, then it's not so
      complex. after reenvisioning a tough issue like that and being
      open minded, the next step is to be capable of efficiently
      communicating that to others and cutting through the stifled,
      chaotic dialogue in this country.

- metaphor to a system of a million random 3D vectors of varying
  direction and magnitude.  If you sum a random or almost random
  system of vectors like this, what do you end up with?
  - a very small vector representing the sum of change in the system.
  - just throwing numbers out: the magnitude could be 1/100 to 100
    times the magnitude of the average vector
- now what if that system contains the same number of vectors of a
  similar distribution of magnitude, where they have been reoriented
  so that the face towards mostly the same direction.
  - when you sum them, you get a vector that's somewhere between
    10,000 and 1,000,000 times the magnitude of the original vector
- explain the metaphor as the energy of individuals
  - if it's all completely random, then it all basically cancels
    itself out
- we all agree that we need changes and we all recognize mostly the
  same set of serious problems in society. Where the left and right
  depart is on proposing solutions to those problems. What I want to
  do is unite the left and the right, so that we can truly accomplish
  something great in America and in the world.

  - sometime soon, i'll write a post on the differences between the
    freedom of the individual and the freedom of the community. (move
    this somewhere else)
    - particularly, i'll discuss that they are fundamentally at odds
      with each other. individuals should have the freedom to live the
      life they want, without judgement.
      - so we need a system that enables that
      - but small, local communities also deserve the freedom to build
        the community they want and one that
        - and we need a system that allows local communities to depart
          from the mainstream on some social issues
    - but the point here is that the left and the right are at each
      others throats over this stuff. but we need a country that has
      both. the federal government has no business telling you what is
      moral and what is not. they should make laws that enforce
      ethics, but morality is something for individuals, families and
      communities to decide. yet, if communities lack that freedom,
      then we have problems.

  - if we could figure out a system where we have both the freedom of
    the individual and the freedom of the community, where the left
    and right don't have to fight about this, then imagine the
    progress we could make for america.

      When and so when we make people aware that we all know we want
      essentially the same thing,
      - we all want the chance to work hard and be rewarded for that
        hard work,
      - then we can motivate everyone
        to work towards making America greater. We can build it and we
        will be faster, stronger and longer lasting.


### Equilibrium & Social Dynamics

why "equilibrium" ?
- it's a fancier, more mathematic term that enables me to think about
  this idea in a slightly more mechanical way
  - that is, everyone has un/concscious motivations and desires at any
    given moment ..
    - but we're all familiar with the concept of "time"
    - and so we're not so concerned with what we "want" now as much as
      with what we're moving towards (and what the system we are part
      of is moving towards)
      - this allows us to anticipate what we'll want "then" for some
        point in the future
      - or what we'll need to continue to accomplish later
    - this has more to do with anticipating your needs/desires or that
      of others and how they will change in the future, so that you
      can meet those wants/needs in a more efficient way that may also
      be longer lasting (if you're meeting some future want/need that
      will feel more satisfying later on)
  - so, equilibrium is that place we want to find ourselves which
    satisfies that urge to keep going
    - i'm definitely driven by dopamine, so when that goes out, i'm
      pretty much done......
    - .....

#### why is it useful?

determining motivations in situations or relationships
- equilibrium usually lines up with goals/desires, but not always
- sometimes it's easier to determine than un/conscious
  motivations/desires
  - but it's usually harder for someone to hide
  - because by reaching their equilibrium (if they're exhibiting
    rational behavior) then they've moved towards their goals, whether
    they've stated those goals to you or not


if you are the sum of the five people you spend the most time with, as
is so cleverly stated, then what happens when the five people that you
talk with are total dicks to you and leave you feeling visibly upset?!
- and don't seem to care. and put you down when you come up with an
  idea "that oh yeh, someone already thought of that one time..."
- what if you don't even talk to 5 people in a week? what if you there
  are only two or three people that you speak more than 30 words to?
  - what kinda emotional state is that going put someone in?
  - why the fuck is everyone in my life PERFECTLY FINE with
    coincidental conditions that, when observed in the right way, are
    almost TACTICALLY designed to put me in a really shitty emotion
    state
- for me, not everyone sees it BECAUSE I DONT SEE ANYONE EVER!!
  - a lot of that has to do with me, personally. i haven't had normal
    social relationships for at least 5 years, but really for a
    decade.
    - so i don't have any normal social habit i can reinforce
    - and there don't seem to be very many people that want to reach
      out and help me.
    - yet, every person i talk to will sound supportive and some offer
      to help
      - i know that a lot of those people are genuinely concerned
  - yet, i don't ever see anyone!
    - and it would seem that people want me to be isolated, so they
      can tell my story for me.
    - they want to contain me
    - they don't become concerned until i try to call attention to
      something. and i feel like people accuse me of being
      manipulative or whatever, but really I'm at the butt end of like
      a dozen current abusive relationships

#### where does this person seek equilibrium?

given some constant set or sets of social situations
- given routine and time, people will seek their equilibrium with that
  situation or set of situations
  - there are way too many people who aren't even aware of what
    their goals/intents/equilibrium are
  - wayyyy too many of these people
- most people will cease 2 pursue equilibrium once they've found it
  - this is also known as this "basic" or "simple" or "sophomoric"
  - many of these people are so exhausted by the time they get
    "equilibrium" that their behavior quickly collapses after they
    think they get it (or think they're going to get it)
  - often there are people who are so consumed with chasing some
    crude ideal of equilibrium, that they never actually get a break
    - these people are sometimes called "high strung"
  - there are people who are chasing some idea of equilibrium that is
    unstable in some way
    - this is where messing with someone's social model is really
      messed up because you can delude or confuse someone into chasing
      the wrong things.
      - and if they don't know any better or if no one tells them or
        if they don't actually ever see or talk to someone that would
        be honest about it
        - then that person, depending on how you've manipulated them,
          might actually fuck their life, over and over and over
          again, all by their bad little self!!
    - maybe the conditions to achieve what they want are unstable
      - and they closer they get to it, the further they are pushed
        away. this is pretty hard to watch.  most people begin to
        understand they're not going to get something.
      - other people are continually lured in by others..
    - maybe the conditions that satisfy equilibrium for this person
      are chaotic and it quickly breaks down
      - honestly (IMO) the faster the better. fail fast!
      - if something's going to break, i want to be expecting it to
        break. i don't want it to happen when i've settled down and
        feel safe.
  - there are plenty of people who have no idea what they're chasing
    - it might be subconscious, but there's a feeling deep down and it
      compels their behavior. it doesn't need to be rational

- and there are people who don't stop once they've acheived
  equilibrium (with respect to a situation, relationship or goal)
  - good to test this in general. kinda like leaning in to something
    to see how far you can get. sometimes it's not great to test.
  - and these people continue working until they either exhaust
    themselves and rest.
    - or they don't let up and move to the next thing on their list
    - it really depends on how hardworking the person is and how much
      they want the goal in front of them
      - and how certain they are that if they don't get it now,
        they're going to figure out how to take it, just so it's one
        less thing to worry about
        - (if you find yourself on the other end of this, you're
          probably a little closer to getting fired)
  - but, whether this person who has reached some equilibrium will
    continue is mostly dependent on how much they want something
    - and whether they want something else more
      - every person can only pursue one action at a time.
      - the way around that is by convincing someone else to lend you
        their time (via employment, etc..)
  - there are people who anticipate the equilibrium they're seeking
    and by the time they reach it, they've adjusted their course for
    something else
    - this can be disastrous (if you're like myself and give up
      learning once you know you could eventually do something)
    - but otherwise, this is one of the determining factors for
      success in business & elsewhere
      - it's your ability to anticipate the impending arrival of the
        equilibrium that drives your behavior that allows you to
        adjust course and make more use of your time/etc
    - some people just excel at anticipating this and adjusting course
      to get more done
      - i.e. order more product, so that when stock sells out, you
        don't have to turn away customers (or lose them)

- and there's the person that seeks equilibrium and never intends to
  stop for a second.
  - this can either be a priceless asset or ticking time bomb
  - the person that never intends to stop is either inhumanly
    motivated by genius (or perhaps childhood trauma, etc. wahtever)
    - or they're just sociopaths (or psychopaths)

- these all apply to business and to life ... but ...
  - the concept of equilibrium is very powerful when applied to
    relationships and social situations.
    - and this becomes even more fascinating with social dynamics and
      social groups
      - which group or person's sense of equilibrium wins out over the
        rest and why?
      - what determines this?
        - IMO, it's the most effective communicators who most strongly
          indicate their equilibria and/or motivations
  - and that's really waht I meant to cover here
    - if you have a relationship that needs work, what do you do to
      make sure it continues moving forward

### Social Dynamics - Equilibrium and Gradient

if the social variables are imagined as a hyperdimensional coordinate
system, then
- you can imagine the person's state,
  - as well as their environment's and social participants' state,
  - all mapped as points(or something)
- visualizing the specifics really aren't important here. it's the
  high level concepts
  - and most of this, if processed by a person's mind, is subconscious
    anyways. so it's not something most ppl understand, nor is it
    something we could consciously process
- that person's state depends on all the other variables
  - I.E. their perception of their own state and that of others around
    them, including social groupings, etc.
  - this informs their subconscious of the equilibrium they'd want to
    seek in that situation. the equilibrium could be plotted as points
    or regions in that same hyperdimensional space (or one could get
    more complicated...)
  - those "regions" could be imagined as slices of space carved away
    by inequalities.
    - or ... ugh i don't know lol

#### Generalized Social Mechanics Scenario

- *this is when i had the AHA moment w/ social physics*
  - "social mechanics" didn't lead to a google result initially
  - then i found the HMOL site, but i haven't read much of the content

- the point is, one can take into account the calculus of this
  situation. the rate at which other participants change or the rate
  of change of their personal state in this situation.
  - but it gets better.
  - when the participants of a group are making decisions, they seek
    to hide, omit, or manipulate information.
    - at any time, regardless of the truth of their words/actions or
      the significance of their omissions, a person can imagine that
      these people specifically want to indicate that they are *going
      toward* or *moving away* from that "thing" they want by
      manipulating information
    - THEREFORE, you can use the gradient in this hyperdimensional
      plane in various ways, inferring that someone's conscious
      actions or omitted actions indicate action towards/away from
      that LINE indicated by the gradient of their action.
      - imagine a 3D coordinate system (X,Y, & Z)
      - think of a competitive version of the game snake
      - there's a dozen red dots on it representing people that each
        want to go towards or away from blue dots plotted on the same
        coordinate system
        - the blue dots are like the food in this 3d version of snake
      - there's a hundred blue dots and each person has a secret list
        of 20 blue points to obtain
        - each is variously weighted for each person. one dot could be
          worth 100 points to one person and 5 points to the next. who
          knows, but the red dots generally don't want to indicate
          that information.
      - the red dots can move, over time and each have their own
        algorithm for making decisions, independent from others. each
        red dot receives the same information and understands that all
        the others do too (or perhaps they don't...)
        - they can move at different speeds, dependent on their score
        - really, there's all kinds of restrictions/modifications here
      - the point is: one of the most effective algorithms for
        determining the goal of other red dots is by observing the
        gradient of their actions.
        - I.E. if one red dot fakes by moving away from a blue dot,
          but doesn't do so *orthogonally*
          - and there's no other point which they are obviously moving
            towards
          - then one could assume that red point has behavior tightly
            coupled to that point they were either moving directly
            toward or directly away from
        - and the way to do this is by measuring the gradient of
          several vars in this hyperdimensional plane
          - this plane could be constructed from the powerset of red
            dots and their general directions
          - this information is exposed to each red dot's algorithm
            would need to process differently
          - in this case, the hyperdimensional plane is used to plot
            the features of an individual red dot's AI understanding
            of the system.
            - these feature sets can be modified!
              - dimensions added/removed
              - measures/metrics changed
              - priorities shifted
            - these feature sets can vary between red dots!
          - and most crucially, there is reflection of each red
            dot's understanding of how the other red dots process
            information.
            - this must similarly be malleable. even more flexible,
              given the unknown nature of how each red dot's
              algorithm works.
          - and again, another crucial step of understanding is that
            there is a dualistic reflection of how each red dot
            perceives each of the other's individual AI reflection of
            their presented information
            - or at least, theoretically, one could extend this into
              infinity.
            - what A thinks that B thinks what A is thinking about
              what B is thinking .... etc
              - this is tough, but there's a ton of valuable info here
            - another step is that this information must be
              generalizable to hierarchical groups
            - and another crucial step is that, in addition to
              infinite reflection of *paired* AI algorithms, there is
              also an infinite reflection of "what A thinks that B
              thinks about what A thinks of C ..."
              - for not just pairs, but all possible sequences of red
                dots in the graph
            - much of this reflected data for AI is useless beyond one
              or two levels. however, it's really, really difficult
              and tedious to obscure your actions, even beyond a
              single level

basically: two incredibly powerful ways to understand social dynamics
and group behavior, in addition to ascertaining other people's
equilibriums:
- look at the "gradients" of their actions to infer whether they are
  lying, omitting, manipulating, etc.
  - generally, unless their action is "significantly orthogonal" from
    their goal (i'm sure there's a measure for orthogonality in
    hyperdimensional planes ... seems useful)
    - then you can generally surmise (especially over time!) that they
      are moving *toward* or *deceptively away from* their (un)stated
      goals!
- combine the gradient with the reflection ideas from above
  - "what A thinks that B thinks what A is thinking about what B is
    thinking .... etc"
  - "what A thinks that B thinks about what A thinks of C ..."
