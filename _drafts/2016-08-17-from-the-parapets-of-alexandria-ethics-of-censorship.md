### Part Two: Ethics of Censorship in the 21st Century

In the 21st century, lightning fast communication and augmented
algorithmic distillation will magnify the effects that ideas have on
our world. Technology will become more volatile and accessible.
Therefore, governments, organizations and industries will attempt to
justify broad censorship to regulate technology & communication,
citing promotion of safety.

> Imagine if Hip Hop was illegal. Open source software. Encryption so
> software. Religious Texts. Dear God, we have to burn the Tony
> Robbins books and videos. Self-help books are for the terrorisks!
> Empowered people are dangerous people in the 21st century factory
> farm!

They are well justified in doing some of this, but this is precisely
the danger. The more powerful organizations of industry and government
will attempt to craft regulations which benefit them in some way.
Further, various governments may attempt widespread censorship. These
pushes towards censorship that are self-motivated or complete will
stifle both economic development and humanity's development as a
whole, on a regional scale as well as global.

### Ethical Questions for the Information Age

#### From a utilitarian perspective, what are the costs, risks and benefits to limiting those forms of speech?

#### What are the ethical and moral arguments that bestow authority to justify strict regulation of information?

#### What do we gain when we censor a subculture or artist?

#### What do we lose with censorship of art and culture?

#### What about technology or information for empowerment?

#### If we censor such technological information, what do we gain and lose?

#### Could we accidentally limit humanity's own development through overly strict censorship of academia and technology?

#### What determines what is just with regard to censorship in the 21st century?

#### If you censor someone online by muting or isolating them, when is it ethical to do so without notifying that user?

#### For political & cultural censorship, is it ethical to leverage feedback loops & flaws in social media algorithms to encourage the development of specific trends, some of which may be divisive? e.g. Encouraging someone to post more radical viewpoints by clustering the user in a group exposed to more of the same topics, creating a "Black Twitter" or "Trump Twitter"

#### With automated censorship, how do we manage the risk for unintended consequences? i.e. How do we minimize users not in violation that are affected & vice versa, when they are not prompted with any indication how/why they are in violation & there's no human element in the mix?

# [21st Century Ethical Paradox](#21st-century-ethical-paradox)

> Utilizing the internet's free access to the sum of information on
> planet Earth implicitly allows service providers to index your mind,

>

The internet allows free exchange of information, but at the cost of
profiling your mind's set of knowledge and information.  So you can
access whatever information you want, but as you do, intermediates
become more aware of everything you might have read. Depending on how
technologies like eye-tracking penetrate user interfaces, this could
mean that every word or image you view generates an indication of that
event. Other augmentations to user interfaces are more powerful and
complete.

Service providers can maintain & assess populations, groups or
individuals for a distribution of information and knowledge. Or, it
might be an AI algorithm that aggregates that data and constructs
profiles based on each user. Furthermore, there are hundreds of
metrics that Google uses as redundant means of identifying
users. These include IP Address, Chrome Login Status, and even UI
metrics like Window Size.

This capacity makes it very difficult to use web/mobile products
without leaving behind a trail of logs and metadata. Both Facebook's
Like buttons and Google's redundant means of identifying users track
you across the internet. Even if you blew away your Chrome browser and
reinstalled, Google may still be able to identify your user
interactions against others, even if you switch VPN's. Obviously, if
you're hacking, don't use Chrome.

I'm not lambasting Google's data collection, just emphasizing that
Google, Facebook, NSA and others have the ability to trivially track
you across the internet, should they want to target you. And the price
you pay for instant, unimpeded access to a mostly universal data set
is that you're allowing these entities to construct profiles which
indicate the knowledge and info.

The most selective information would be very safe in Google's data
centers and occasionally NSA data centers ... lulz. For most other web
applications, the records are distributed b/w client and server, but
those can be subject to compromise, aggregation and analysis. (finish
paragraph)

- include information
- move some of this to the section on Internet/Social Media censorship

### (Paradigm Changes)

- the paradigm here changes if/when
  [quantum networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_network)
  (QN) and
  [Future Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Internet)
  architectures become prevelant.
  - quantum networking means that the communication fabric itself will
    not only become decentralized, but is implicitly nonlocal. This
    might represent the most important paradigm shift in computing
    since networking. It could also be impossible, so there's
    that. The design of portable QN devices will likely present
    engineering problems like size, power and form factor constraints,
    related to superconduction and minimizing interference.

  - Some technologies will become useful around 2020 because they
    compliment demands for Augmented Reality applications. Future
    Internet tech like content centric networking means that data is
    not made available to the network by address, but is instead
    locatable and routable by name and dataset hierarchy.  The data
    sharded along various dimensions, like application data structure,
    and is cached as close to the user as possible. Honestly, it's not
    a technology I would bet on, as QN may eventually outmode it.

# Have You Heard the Good News?!

### Our Brains May Themselves Be Quantum Computers, Complete with .

    though there are likely mechanical engineering, power and
    size constraints for portable QN devices.


#### Future Internet: Content Centric Networking

#### [CCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_centric_networking)

#### [NDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_data_networking)

#### [ICN]()

ultimately constructing a profile that can be used to psycholanalyze
you, stalk you, blackmail you.

This is unavoidable via the accumulation, analysis, & shared records
of your online behavior. In fact, hacked database tables from web
applications can be pieced together to put together a scarily accurate
profile of someone! Raw or processed data like this might be valuable
on the black market, though I hardly think I'd be giving someone that
idea.

That's pretty scary, right? 怖いね？

- this paradox:
  -

    it becomes easier to understand what information someone has
    accessed, that "free" exchange leads to


  because every web request leaves behind logs & metadata on the
    client, server and the routers in between.

    - increased surveillance
      - and it seems to be used quite often for HUMINT!!
    - permanent record of interests/knowledge

  - this paradox has a sociological dimension because of the near
    total penetration of digital communication
    - (as % of population using digital vs non-digital communication)
    - can't be sure that text-based communications are real
      - voice/video communcations are also fallible (last episodes of
        quantico) ..
    - but if 100% of people nearly 100% of the time are using easily
      monitored, insufficiently encrypted communication channels, that
      fuels the sociological phenomenon I mentioned.
      - problems verifying authenticity/identity lead to legal axioms
        being questioned
    - (restructure/throw away ... i donno if this belongs here or
      maybe in the section on censorship in social media)

  - this paradox w/ nature of singularity makes a re-evaluation of
    tech/censorship ethics necessary.. (reword)
  - lead into section on tyranny

### Balancing Information Distribution and Group Dynamics in Uncharted Territory


# Dimensions Driving Ethics in Modern Censorship

(move to part one?)

These mass communication platforms are fundamentally different than
previous systems, which were easier to control because they were
hierarchical and the economics of radio/TV production implied limited
choice. The internet and social media represent almost an inversion of
the mass communication paradigm. Instead of being communication from
few-to-many, social media platforms enable many-to-many communication.
This was originally a democratization of mass communication. However,
we've seen a decade's worth of development produce mechanisms for
control that obfuscate and otherwise simple, decentralized system. A
decade of social media, trolls and bots have masked signal with noise.

Every message must travel on infrastructure and within application
platforms give way to the bottleneck that present the most effective
mechanisms of control. If this was Thermopylae, the infrastructure and
platform bottlenecks represent the chokepoints of the narrow stretches
of the shores along the Gulf of Malia. This is where someone exerts
the greatest amount of technical control over disseminated content,
user behavior, data for analytics and application functionality.

The internet of circa 2025 simply doesn't present these same
chokepoints. Furthermore, virtual reality introduces changes in UX/UI
that fundamentally change the nature of user interaction, types of
data collected and the economics of tech products. The combination of
future networking paradigms, which are decentralized, coupled with the
less discretizable user interactions of VR/AR imply that this capacity
for strict control over the dissemination of information simply
evaporates.

*THEREFORE, IF SOMEONE WANTED TO COLLAPSE THE SYSTEM THEY
WOULD DO IT IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS!!*

### Peak Tyranny

That's one reason why I'm very passionate about this issue right
now. It's urgent that we promote stability because the risk to be
trapped within a totalitarian system is very high. Total censorship at
this moment in history creates a possibility for collapse into a
totalitarian system, where that next internet technology revolution
that enables a purely decentralized, uncensorable paradigm simply
never emerges. That is, the nature of the system right now may entice
some set of tyrants to act now because later, they might not have the
chance.




### Understanding Intent of Policy, Strategy & Goals

- understanding the intent (ethics usually does revolve around
    intent),
  - need to promote cultural/economic stability
    - without limiting innovation
  - risk for duplicity of intent in rapidly evolving fields,


### Restriction of Individuality


### Control Over Our Ascent Towards the Singularity


###

### Real and Intellectual Property Rights

- increased focus on user agreements and things that are leased to
  you, but "because the technology is 'dangerous'" you don't actually
  have the right to own things from specific future industries
  - industries which are likely to be locked down in this way include
    nanotech, biotech, 3D printing, artificial intelligence
- there may be a fundamental deconstruction of the AI industry and
  subsequent reconstruction, in terms of the distribution of
  intellectual property.
  - this obfuscation would allow people who own certain intellectual
    property rights to artificially restrict the distribution of
    services rendered via IP & Tech they onw.
  - this would also be useful (but perhaps unwise) in the nanotech,
    biotech & 3D printing industries, where the pricing structure of
    products built with 3D printers or nanotech is based on a
    redesign/reorientation of the services
    - this might indicate a smoother transition from products derived
      via traditional manufacturing processes to those printed via
      nanotech or 3D printing. i.e. instead of selling printers or
      nanotech, people who are licensed to own the tech can lease time
      to people (or something), while allowing for prices to be set
      closer to the value in the traditional market
    - this might avoid a price crash (or something IDFK) it's also
      very anti-free market.

- protecting copyright. how does copyright change here?
  - (... more here ...)

### Promoting Safety and Preventing Disaster


### Awareness of Knowledge


- awareness of an increased potential for negligence (keep?)
  - esp. with respect to economic policy & investment

### Unintended Consequences

- general description of unintended consequences

- problems where policy is implemented, which encourages smoother
  transition through high-innovation cycles. this is going to be a bit
  of a tempation for products like self-driving cars or 3D printing.
  - policy makers might pushback on automakers to restrict
    self-driving capacity, citing security concerns. another option
    would be to limit the self-driving feature's geographic
    availability or something.
  - the point is to prevent a crash for competitor products by
    lengthening the transition time. for self-driving cars, a cautious
    transition is best
  - however, this is counter to one of America's greatest strengths
    and perhaps our nation's most critical goal: remaining at the
    forefront of the technology frontier.
    - if we artificially slow the rates of these technological
      transitions, we allow ourselves more time & attention to push
      coherent, adaptive economic policy. we'll be more capable of
      observing and reacting to trends.
    - however, it may be foolish

### Unforeseen Circumstances and Turbulant Group Dynamics

- the rapidly changing environment implies that information signals
  are more important and the potential for false/misleading
  information to have a greater economic/cultural/political impact is
  also greater.
  - humanity has gone from processing almost completely local signals
    in the 19th century to processing almost completely global signals
    - where local signals are almost an after thought

- rapidly evolving fields present unforeseen opportunities amid
  turbulent cultural/economic conditions

  - (reword all of this) the problems here are caused by the nature of
    of ... (this system? the turbulence? the opportunities presented?)
    - or the nature of people and group behavior in a high-risk,
      high-stakes system with high uncertainty
      - coupled with less insurance or foundation
        - it's impossible to take anything for granted

  - (these turbulent conditions mean that opportunities that were
    unpredicted will present themselves)
    - with economic turbulence, this implies rapid growth in some
      industries with rapid losses in industries thought to be solid
      long-term investments
  - groups may be more pressed to act
    - because of group risk/losses
    - or because they were presented with an opportunity neither their
      group nor their adversaries foresaw


### Authority Over Content Creation, Classification, Distribution and Permanence

- control over this means you control who sees what

- there's some messed up things that can be done with splinternet.
  - (maybe move this to the social media article)
  - you can publish different news articles in various states or
    regions, but block them in the alleged "originating" region. using
    social media posts to trend some major event like a flood or
    earthquake supposedly on the West Coast, while promoting the
    article within the united states but in every region except the
    West Coast. So everyone gets the impression that it happened and
    social media artifacts are restricted from blacklisted regions.
  - it's actually possible to use internet balkanization to do exactly
    that! it's not guaranteed to work, but if you're running the same
    games across thirteen regions, where reach region is so vigorously
    dicussing twelve trending, highly-emotional events happening in
    other areas, most people are probably going to be too busy to
    validate the non-existent event in their own area.
    - it requires some funky social media application configuration
      and lots of influence over the newsfeed algorithms
    - it's mostly an impossible, high-level idea, but it is possible

The interdependent nature of these communication platforms, coupled
with lack of understanding, constant flux, and uncertainty in how
interactions of players contribute to the platform's small & large
scale behavior patterns. This presents a legal argument in & of
itself. By affecting the free speech of one person via manipulation of
social media algorithms, you are also affecting and therefore
regulating the speech of everyone using that platform. This argument
is similar to, but cannot be predicated upon the *indirect affect on
aggregate commerce* argument presented by the federal government in
the 2005 Supreme Court case, [Gonzales
v. Raich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich). This
argument referenced the precident set in the 1942 Supreme Court case
on taxation of wheat, [Wickard
v. Filburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn).

In regard to government interference in newsfeed algorithms, this
argument asserts that freedom of speech might also be interpreted as
independence of speech. While the argument needs a valid foundation of
case law and precendent, it may present a means by which the
government's regulation of speech via digital means could be reigned
in. By altering how people or topics are incentivized by social media
algorithms, the federal government compels foreign & domestic users to
adopt viewpoints or avoid speaking out on specific topics. Otherwise,
they can be automatically censured by newsfeed algorithms. Further, by
nearly muting one person's speech or amplifying another's on a social
media product, you affect the entire social media ecosystem. This can
be done by directly interfering with the operation of social media web
application servers/data or indirectly through SEO-style farming of
interactions and content. It's hard enough for newsfeed algorithms to
function properly, but we see the government picking and choosing
winners in what is essentially an information marketplace. The
question of whether the government is picking and choosing the correct
winners is concerning enough, but the greater question is whether the
government is even capable of doing so without causing greater harm to
itself

# Factions Invested For or Against Censorship

### Corporations and Multinational Conglomerates

These factions will have interest in controlling technology.
Particularly, the IP behind nanotech and gentech, which the entities
invested will identify, brand and market as dangerous for several
reasons. First, these technologies truly are dangerous. So they'll
want to work together to shield the industry as a whole from
liability, PR disaster, and perceived risk.  Second, they'll want to
control the technology to profit from it themselves. Sharing
information in general means that subsequent technology becomes easier
to develop. Finally, at the investor level, people who fund these
businesses want redundant, tight mechanisms of control over the
progression of this technology.

### National Security (Tech, Police & Policy)

Agencies and organizations focused on national security will want to
hang on to this social media paradigm of user interaction in the
internet. Virtual reality is so fundamentally different that it
becomes harder to monitor. Google, Facebook, etc will not be able to
index UI/UX data around it, which is what most of those business
models are based on. This implies a revolution in business strategy
for the consumer-facing aspects of technology industries.

However, from the perspective of government agencies, this is
detrimental. They want to monitor their users' activity by
piggy-backing off of the data generated by legitimate products. They
want a more centralized set of user applications, where the power is
in the hands of a few organizations.

Therefore, National Security organizations' interests in censorship
are more subtle and general: they want to mold the industry into
particular kinds of shapes that are easier to manipulate. Right now,
the technology industries deliver data for intelligence in a way that
outmatches any future development: it's about as good as it's ever
going to get. They will resist any movement away from the current
paradigm of user interaction in technology.

In America, these organizations want you to have enough freedom to
speech, so that you'll feel comfortable enough to self-identify
online. Or, at least, that's how it's felt since Sept 11th, 2001. DHS,
especially, will fuck with your life and you will have no clue what
hit you.

### Political Parties

Particularly in democracies, groups like political parties, think
tanks and lobbyists will want to be able to exert influence over the
conversation on social media and technology. These organizations,
whether operating in official government capacity, will also want to
hang on to that same social media paradigm.

### Political Movements

### Military Organizations

### Individuals

### Academic Institutions

- these people will be motivated by a fear that free discussion
  will be stifled

### The People

- consumers, plaintiffs, regular people
  - these people will be motivated by fear (of technology and
    tech-powered terrorism)
    - fear will be the strongest motivation here.

So, we see some major forces driving the debate around free speech.
- is there a better term than "forces" ?
- corporate forces (seeking to establish a cartel/monopolism/etc
  around a specific technology and/or industry)
- political forces
  - these will seek to repurpose censorship for safety in technology
    towards their own agendas
- security forces
  - homesec, etc.
- the people
  - academics


### (some groups might be locked out and unable to study/learn specific things)

  - discuss how these organizations and groups might achieve total
    power and lock others out
    - this departes from the kind of total power seen before in that
      the common person is not neglected in poverty. because
      technology enables cheap solutions, once we build it out, we
      shouldn't actually need much of anything.
      - this is problematic for it's own reasons...

- (i have a real tendency to get off track. do i really need to move
  towards this?)

# Reasons/Analysis For Factions Wanting Censorship

- to prevent technological disaster
  - by assessing capabilities of people
- to prevent/control the spread of info
  - particularly that which may undermine social institutions
  - to prevent hysteria in the middle of a crisis
- to isolate people by controlling the social connections b/w people
  - managing HUMINT networks
- managing SIGINT/MASINT networks & data flow
  - control over the design of UI/UX interactions can enable
    accumulation of more useful data.
  - reactive/proactive SIGINT & MASINT
    - implying the use of social media & SEO
- for general social engineering
  - to encourage people to access some topics over others
  - to encourage some behaviors and discourage others
  - to cull out specific cultural artifacts
- to totally lock down access to information sources
  - to monitor


### (Profit & Market/IP control)


### (censorship for safety & tech)

After VR evolves into AR and machine-learning has been patented to
death, the next opportunities are found in biotechnology, genomic data
sciences, nanotechnology, 3D printing and advanced computing
technologies, which can have high-risk, high-impact consequences.

However well-meaning this censorship and development of technology may
be, in the end, it will set us back as a nation and as a species. It
may lock us within a cage of which we are unaware. It will happen
faster than we will realize and once it does, we may never again have
the chance to correct it. It's tendency to stunt humanity's
development may ultimately sow the seeds for our own undoing. There is
no pursuit more honorable or more beneficial than the pursuit of
knowledge. And we'll face a situation where not only does the natural
evolution of culture in the presence of technology undermine the
incentives motivating the pursuit of knowledge, but also humanity's
fear of technology will make such pursuits illegal! In a way, it
already has!

In itself, this begs at least a hundred questions, but I want to
discuss the ethics of censorship. When is it ethiccally permissible to
restrict the development and exchange of ideas. This is important
because, as I've stated, the 2020's will necessitate that we strongly
regulate technology. Further, it seems that we will seek to regulate
political speech as well, but each will drive the other: pursuit of
censorship for technology will entice the pursuit of censorship of
political speech. And vice versa.

So, how can we do this safely, without stepping on individuality or
freedom? Would Hip Hop have been developed in the 80's without free
speech? Was there a movement like Hip Hop born in Soviet Russia or
China? Was a movement like that born in Libya? Citizens in Libya were
so restricted, they were unable to learn foreign languages. Would a
cultural movement like Hip Hop be likely to spread internationally or
even be born in a country that's not allowed to have contact with the
outside?! HELL NO! The conditions limiting outside or inter-regional
contact necessarily prevent people birthing a social movement from
networking to the outside. So no, a social movement like that would
not be born in those conditions because it could not possibly be.

categories of reasons & benefits/drawbacks of censorship



TODO: split into a part 3 UGHHHHHHH


<a name="censorships-effect-on-cultural-development" />

# [Censorship's Effect on Cultural Development](#censorships-effect-on-cultural-development)

What effect does censorship have on development of society, culture,
technology and discourse? This can be demonstrated with many examples
where restricted discourse led to stagnated development in each of
these dimensions of humanity. This stagnated discourse leads to dead
ends in the graph of knowledge, for individuals and groups.
Blacklisting and whitelisting knowledge restricts requisite knowledge,
without which humanity simply cannot progress further.  This leads to
a phenomenon, where in contrast to the Singularity, progress
plateaus. In any case, a plateau or stepped progression may be
natural, but this is a certainty, given a level of censorship. Our
progression will end there.

Central to this series is the observation that the global elites could
not have misunderstood the progression of technology and it's effect
on the dissemination of information. How widespread this understanding
was is less clear, but I believe that we have been misled with false
futurism. Understanding how these global elites knew and knowing how
they knew furthers my belief that they intent to enact a global
reset. Regardless of what the ruling class in each country knew and
when, people understand now the power that free information and
knowledge impart! Knowledge is power!

I am trying to warn people that if you do not appreciate this power
and stand up for it right now, it will be taken from you. I will also
show that there are many reasons for *some information* to be
restricted. This will act as a duplicitous cover to restrict
dissemination of *all information*. This is sad because we are
entering an age where decentralized, unmonitized and truly free
transmission of information cannot be impeded, which is why, if there
were to be a total collapse, it would occur now. As in right now. As
in within the next few years. A decade at the most.

### [Censorship on Expression: Flag Burning](#censorship-on-expression-flag-burning)

What do flag burning laws and citations give us as citizens? When we
trade freedom for that particular expression, how does that effect
society and culture? IMO, it's mostly symbolic. Maybe it should be a
minor misdemeanor to pull people into the courtroom. Does prohibition
of flag burning effect our culture as much as prohibiting a language,
artform or music genre?

Flag burning exemplifies the debate over reasonable limits on free
speech for art or protest. IMO, flag burning should be legal. However,
it is one of the dumbest forms of expression. Not only is it
completely disrespectful to American values permitting free speech,
when used as a form of protest, it runs counter to the protestors'
stated goals. It's an ignorant form of expression which will alienate
you from the people in America who can change things.

IMO, since as speech for protest, it is ignorant and countereffective,
the only case in which flag desecration would be "acceptable" would be
when it is used for art. My reasoning is that you might be able to
convey a message involving a burned flag that isn't anti-American, but
very much patriotic. Still, what art involves desecrating the flag?
What kind of art is that and does it really offer value in its
message? Usually art that goes straight for shock value is shit.

The people who do this usually want attention. That's all. It's a
cheap ploy and a shameful use of free speech IMO, especially in the
US. Why would you do that? It's degrading towards the very things we
stand for! Aren't there better, more constructive ways to get your
message out?! By burning the US flag, you're saying you don't give a
fuck about the right to free speech that gives you the right to do
that in the first place! *AND FOR WHAT?!* What higher purpose could
possibly stir you to burn the American flag? Isn't there a better way
to try display the "speech" or the "argument" you're trying to make by
burning the flag?

No, the people who do this are usually trying to stir up resentment
against America or they do it out of ignorance. I'm not sure which one
is worse. And it's highly unlikely that a person who's truly
sacrificed for this country via military service would ever burn a
flag! I'm sure it has happened... Furthermore, the people who have
actually been through severe trauma at the fault of a country aren't
likely to want to attract attention by burning flags, especially at a
political or otherwise widely visible events

I don't understand why someone would do it other than to fan flames of
anti-american resentment. It's something to do to attract attention
and stir up an emotional response, intended to grow support for
something which undermines the very essence of america, which are the
inalienable rights we hold sacred. It's those rights which would
permit someone to commit such an act without recompense.

**It's that action *for superficial, self-defeating gain*, _with assured
impunity_ and *without the sacrifices for freedom* for which _others gave
their lives._ that action is *cowardly* and *short-sighted*.**

I know people have done it before and I don't mean to cast judgement.
Whether it's what they intend to convey or not, someone who does it
completely lacks respect for the values we hold sacred!

Even though it's cowardly and ignorant, it should be legal. Just like
it should be legal to speak freely about other shameful things. It
should definitely be legal. Part of my reasoning is that, if you
should choose to express such disrespectful speech in America, then
I'd love for you to have the opportunity to do that, so you can be
seen doing it. I hope that if you do it or you are known to have done
it, that someone speaks to you and makes you understand why it's just
all around a terrible thing to do. You might as well piss on it.

One should hope we don't have to create laws for flag burning to
prevent our people from using this form of speech as protest. Again,
allowing this speech is a good way for private citizens to engage with
people who self-identify as disrespectfully anti-American.




# [What Is *The Prophecy?*](#what-is-the-prophecy)

TODO: rename this?

Tight control over communication media and content stifles social
change before it has a chance to grow. These policies are usually
implemented in order to encourage some facets of culture blessed by
state or idealogy and to discourage others. It becomes harder for new
cultural developments to take root and grow large enough to challenge
those of the status quo. The next blues, rock or hiphop might simply
never happen.

#### Given Network Growth Without Limitation

### [Reality Converges Towards the Metaphysical](#reality-converges-towards-the-metaphysical)

This starkly departs from some of my previous statements on
culture. Basically, as communication infrastructure encourages the
rapid spread of ideas and information, the speed and bandwidth at
which an memes traverse the globe approaches infinite. Therefore, our
world becomes much more affected and determined by *IDEAS* themselves.
Therefore, physical reality begins to converge towards the
metaphysical.

In other words, as limitations to communication tend toward zero, then
these aethereal metaphysical entities, i.e. beliefs and ideas, begin
to take precedence over the physical realm, regardless of whether
virtual or real, individual or shared, true or false. These ideas
themselves take precendence and their effect on physical reality is
more prominent.  Traditionaly physical qualities of reality begin to
become less important than arbitrarily defined metaphysical
information, which may or may not depend on information accumulated
from some measure on the physical world.

**Because factors related to bandwidth, storage, network connection
degree, processing, indexing and data source/quality/quantity all
optimize, then these are no longer limitations.**

And therefore, aggregate values will also tend to see the same
effect. A statistical model related to some AI algorithm could be
considered metaphysical information that would become nearly
omnipresent. Models of uncertainty could be shared between data
processing entities on such an idealized communication network, *as
though there were no such limitiations on processing, data aggregation
or publishing.* In the most ideal state, *it is as if there is no such
thing as separation of information!* This is important for
metaphysical values such as uncertainty in science experiements or
depth measurements or values tied to physical reality pulled into the
metaphysical realm.

### [Then, Ideas Acquire Life of Their Own](#then-ideas-acquire-a-life-of-their-own)

Ideas begin to take a life of their own and their effects reach into
reality at an ever-increasing pace. They acquire a life of their
own. They are like metaphysical entities which once were bound by slow
information replication rates and then hierarchical control over mass
media. The more we can communicate, the more power ideas have. If
these ideas have such unfathomably increased power, then we need to
pay more attention to them. Therefore, the surveillance and
epidemiology of memes should be measured, quantified, analyzed,
predicted and carefully controlled.

### [Reevaluation of Life, Culture and Society in the Information Age](#reevaluation-of-life-culture-and-society-in-the-information-age)

This was and is *"the prophecy"*, or at least part of it as a was in
mid-May 2013... It's not so much of a religious thing as it is a
complete reunderstanding of the world in the information age. Neither
it nor its implications are incorrect, but instead require a bit of
common sense so we don't go apeshit with censorship and social
engineering. In context and in practicality, ideas and technology can
be very dangerous today and therefore, there is good reason for some
restriction on communication or what people see. However, in the
government's overzealous fervor to censor every damn thing it
disagrees with, we could very easily create a situation where we
stifle innovation at a most critical time. We'll see the most
beautiful thing we've ever created instead roped off or abstracted to
artificially implement hierarchical control or turned against us.

The internet is absolutely glorious in its ability to revolutionize
the world. But like fire, any great tool or technology can be used for
good and can be used for evil. The same technology used to create
plows was used to work metal for weaponry. I fear the day when we can
no longer ask questions or a simple statement can be retroactively
used as justification without proof. Government action can
surreptitiously act against public will, without notification. I have
feared this since high school, at least. I could only predict and
analyze NSA capabilities because of the effort I put into thinking
about what they could do.

### [Our Rights Are Sacred and They Descend From God](#our-rights-are-sacred-and-they-descend-from-god)

Our rights are sacred. They descend from God. They do not come from
man. Man cannot give us our rights and man cannot take them away. Our
founding fathers simply recognized the reality of the social
contract. When government oversteps their bounds, what happens is
that, behind the scenes, God or Providence or whatever you want to
call it acts to stir man against the accumulated sins of tyranny. This
will inevitably occur as long as we can see or talk about tyrannical
acts.

Insofar as I understand, this is why our founders claimed that certain
inalienable rights descended from God. Man's natural tendancy is to be
good and just. When we receive the right information and these
problems are framed in the right way, we will stand against the unjust
suffering of others. If it weren't for this, why should a handful of
academics, politicians and pundits go through such lengths to mislead,
obfuscate, and deceive?

*IT IS BECAUSE THEY FEAR THE PEOPLE.* They fear that the free exchange
of information will lead to drastically reduced education costs and
that people across the world will learn about how they have been
misled, sometimes for good reason, as there are arguments to attack
every policy.

### (importance of information to our economic advantage)

Democracy is the worst form of government, except all the others. Its
biggest weakness is susceptibility of its people and institutions to
foreign influence. During the past two decades, foreign influence in
America has undermined the media with subversion and suggestion. As
bandwidth increases the capabilities of and reliance on information
economy structures, then the power that ideas have on our world
implies our government becomes all the more vulnerable to information.

Given that our corporations publish everything to the world, but
economies like China are all-but-closed, that puts American and
democratic industries at a perpetual disadvantage. Given that our
borders are mostly open, sometimes without reasonable immigration
policy or even a fence, that makes it very easy for a few people to
slip in who mean us harm or could exfiltrate the fraction of data we
haven't published to the world. from 2010 through 2013, I read
countless articles where China was accused of intellectual property
theft and industrial espionage.

Our economy is everything. If America doesn't have an economy, we're
toast. Americans don't understand how our world is changing and we
have enemies who don't want us to respond in time. I am not being
alarmist. I am being realistic. This is how it is going to go
down. They loaned us money and stole F-35 design specs. Yeh the F-35
program. The one where we spent fucking $1.5+ Trillion with a fucking
tee. Actually, I have know idea what the total is I just know it has
13 digits. What the fuck did we borrow and spend that money for? Why
didn't we just let China develop the jet and steal it from them?

### (SIGINT/MASINT/HUMINT)

My point is that we have entered the information age. We live in a
world where surface area to SIGINT, MASINT and HUMINT fucking
matter. This shit is serious. We're worried about who uses which
bathroom and no one bothered to pay attention when they fucking stole
everything! So, information and how it disseminates matters.

We can blind ourselves and stunt our own development by censoring
everything. Free information exchange has advantages as well. Working
in secret or without access to the entire internet is also a major
disadvantage, but what does it matter if foreign hacker syndicates
just steal it from you in the end? Yet, if we don't have free access
to information, we'll never have another Steve Jobs or Einstein or
Elon Musk. Imagine if Albert Einstein was only allowed to view
specific patents. Or the government arbitrarily told him he couldn't
use anything he saw for his own research. Or if he never received any
information from the patent office, but they just decided they didn't
want him to be the guy that published `E=mc^2`... Baby Einstein?
Relativity? *NOT ON My WATCH!!* `E=mc^2` ?! *NOT IN MY 'MERITOCRACY!!*

# (Conclusions for Part Two)

- I never thought there was a border of ideas you weren't supposed to
  cross into. I understood there were things you should avoid knowing,
  but I generally thought that the smarter you were the better off you
  would be. I believed that it was at least a linear relationship.
