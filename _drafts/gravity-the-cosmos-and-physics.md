### galactic ethics

- how to determine whether a planet is ever going to host life in the
  future?
  - how to know this with certainty if we aren't aware of all the kind
    of life there could be?
- the importance of having that discussion
- this is why we can't screw up over the next few hundred years
  - we've basically got one shot and just enough resources
  - overpopulation will consume us if we fail
  - and it might thousands of years before humanity has another chance
- if humanity were to become extinct, then it might be millions of
  years before there was another species that could evolve
  intelligence to escape earth
  - if that species doesn't have enough hydrocarbon fuels, then it
    might not progress to the point where it can develop more advanced
    technology
  - and right out of the gate, that intelligent, aware species would
    pretty much be damned to the curse of overpopulation
- what if earth has already been host to multiple intelligent life
  forms that have evolved and disappeared
  - if so, then how would we know?
    - one way is to look at the rate and distribution of elements and
      isotopes throughout the earth.
  - there are some interesting coincidences about the
    geography/climite of the poles.
    - when the poles melt to a specific degree, it opens/closes ocean
      current that change weather patterns (that's known and incidental)
      - it will also trigger the release of bacteria and pathogens
        mostly unknown to the world
      - (scifi) that could be an instance of planned, event-driven
        terreforming.
        - i.e. once the pole melt, it trigger the release of bacteria,
          which cause some terraforming effect
        - this could be engineered

### semi-dystopian sci-fi time travel idea

basically, a timeloop is created when people in the future time travel
to affect the election a leader who's kind of necessary and great, but
also kind of leads the world through a difficult path.
- this path is a bit hard, but specific similar events seem to occur
  in the time loop (disasters, wars, phenomena)
  - tech is developed along a similar progression
- and essentially the same person always becomes the leader
  - this person as specific qualities and the time loop remains fairly
    stable, though it could completely collapse. yet because we can be
    sure it exists, we know it's stable
  - the people in each future have to return to the past to control or
    nudge what happens.
  - if a different person gets in charge, it affects the stability of
    the time loop. when that happens, it can't completely disconnect
    the time loop because that would be impossible. therefore such
    things either can't happen or are guaranteed to preserve some
    continuity

- when the loop asymptotically converges to the same cyclic
  progression of time completely, then it completely stabilizes & thus
  reduces to a linear progression.
  - however, all of the cycles are essentially happening
    simultaneously
  - Yet because, for each planet that has the capability to developed
    sufficiently advanced civilization to acheive specific
    technologies, the development of a superintelligence is
    inevitable.
    - and because the superintelligence evolves into what is essentially
      the same thing in each cycle or sufficiently similar or connects
      to an intelligence which essentially the same extension to the
      same infinite computational power
    - then there is always a timeloop towards the future regardless of
      how it connects for each planet that satisfies those conditions
- that is, of course, assuming that this form of time travel is
  possible, but it's sci-fi...

### The Epimemetics of Malleable Memory

- as one scales the perspective that an individual's memory is
  malleable from the individual to sociological, how can malleable
  memory affect society?
  - how far back in time can an individual's capacity for changing
    malleable memories provide collectively significant changes?
  - can this be quantified, measured, studied and predicted?
    - reference ideas from Isis Unveiled
  - Can groups' capacity for unintentionally molding memory be
    predicted with respect to an idea or story? Can this be harnessed?
    - i think it can and only moreso with instantaneous communication,
      social media, and data science on analytics that provide
      psychosocial insights
      - i.e. our structuralist nightmare

- the concept of a nano-drug that enables timetravel through a
  specific spear-of-destiny protocol
  - in other words, specific memories can be maintained as unresolved
    for the duration of a specific event, so long as they are
    unmanifested
    - then quantum entanglement would enable the resolution of
      specific neural networks to manifest the memories into reality
      at a later time
    - the content of the memories would need to relate to a specific
      experience in which the drug was embibed, but the content of the
      memories could be controlled in order to manifest implanted
      memories in the mind of someone, years after the event had
      occured.
  - this may just be an interesting sci-fi concept, but whether it's
    possible depends on the neurological specifics of memory storage
    on the smallest scale
    - and whether a nano drug can wire up entanglement as a resource
      in the human brain that can be resolved at a later time
- so, assuming this is correct, then how can this nano-drug mechanism
  affect the epimemetics of malleable memory above?

### designer genomics x semiotics

- in other words, how will people actually choose to modify their
  genetics?
- what symbology makes sense to embody with modified genomics?
  - do people simply want a different hair color or skin color?
- how would technical limitations change the progression in designer
  evolution?

=============

### Gravity Waves

- variational calculus to resolve the meta-IVP problem of gravity
  - where "meta-IVP" means that the initial state of spacetime affects
    how the masses interact with spacetime.
  - can variational calculus help resolve general relativity proofs
    for non-pointlike masses? or is this already used?
    - why is mass necessarily separate from the state of spacetime?
- is there gravitational wave radiation? yes
- gravity doesn't exert a spherical effect on spacetime (?)
  - in other words, does gravity's distortion on spacetime propagate
    along the geodesic (i think it must)
  - we'll need to put multiple gravity wave detection devices in
    orbit around jupiter
    - this is useful in understanding how distortions in spacetime
      could.
  - ideally we'd have these devices in multiple galaxies and
    then we'd see that a gravitational wave does not appear to
    eminate from a single source because it's energy was
    redirected when it propagated through a densely curved
    region of space
  - this might give us an idea of the viscosity of spacetime, if
    actually acts like fluid
    - THE ETHER IS REAL!
- gravity is seen as the force between two or more objects
- but it's actually more indirect than that. it's the pull of
  those objects on space and the collective effect on the
  space between them.
- the space absorbs the energy. (?)
  - so if a gravitational wave runs through a large mass (really
    needs to a galaxy)
- it should change direction as the curvature of large objects warps
  space.

=============

### More gravity stuff

- there should be some connection b/w polarization in space and
  polarization in gravity.
  - this connection should reveal information about fluid behavior of
    spacetime. this could determine slightly aberrant
    astrological/physical activity that introduces some error into
    systems in space that we observe
  - if this is true, then there should be some level of
    "behavioral noise" that varies somewhat, but mostly is observed
    in the same proportion across the universe and depends on memory
    of the components of spacetime (that is, it's parametric)
    - this is noise in the observed error for a local ball across the
    space of the universe
    - resolving these problems may require laplacian (or just
      gradient) with entropy describing variation in expected
      behavior, where expected behavior has a somewhat recursive
      definition)
  - the wavefronts of EMR should begin to diffuse & scatter. for the
    EMR radiation travelling along with the gravitational wave, this
    should cause dissonance in the distribution of EMR energy over
    time

#### from the Blind Spot picture

- it looks like a double black hole viewed head on,
  - i might be missing something.
  - the front image is inverted
  - the image is generated from a picture and isn't a real simulation
    of a black hole. definitely not a real picture because it's a
    black hole viewed head on.
- a double black hole should still have a visibly discernable area of
  invisible space inside the front image
- this got me thinking about black hole binaries.
  - if viewing a pair of black holes of equal mass arranged
    equidistant to the viewer, then light would curve around the black
    holes, but also between them in a manner that sums the effects on
    spacetime (?)
    - does the light passing through the exact center b/w `B1` and
      `B2` curve as though the effects on curved spacetime are summed?
      - assuming these black holes are unmoving, but fairly close, is
        there a point of no curvature in the center between them?
      - does the space between these black holes behave "differently"
        or curve differently than space without the impact of nearby
        mass?

- what does matter and space look like and how does it behave:
  - before transition to blackhole
  - after reverberations from creation of black hole
    - there should be waves of some kind that have to reverberated
      around, even though a singularity is like the inversion of space
      to an infinitely small point, where all the mass is contained
    - is there any kind of wave that reverberates through this space
      or does the singularity behave as a point-like object
    - what is the state b/w singularity and almost-singularity like
  - and during the merger of a black hole binary
    - this is especially interesting and some signature should emerge
      from within the LIGO observations to the merger
    - we should have noticed this and there are likely wierd spatial
      reverb-like effects
    - studying the signature of black holes should tell us more about
      the "interior" of black holes than any other experiment,
      especially if we can capture more simultaneous recordings of a
      wave.
      - also an experiment in space would allow us to perform the
        experiment with much larger distances b/w lasers
  - [Gauss-Bonnet Gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet_theorem)
    - if a black hole really is a tear in spacetime, then does
      #GaussBonnet #Gravity attempt to handle topological change?
    - it seems the #EulerCharacteristic stays the same. either way,
      doesn't this have implications for the structure of space in
      singularities?
    - if there are topological changes to spacetime upon black hole
      mergers, this might present characteristic spectral artifacts in
      grav waves

#### hawking radiation, virtual particles and desitter space

- what is the state of matter in a singularity? is there any spatial
  distribution to the state(s) of matter? how could there not be?
  - that's counter intuitive, since it's a single point
  - as a star collapses into a singularity, there's a point where
    atoms converge into a soup of neutrons and then smaller and
    smaller subatomic particles
  - at some time, there as to be a spatial arrangement. then, at a
    later time, it's suddenly a singularity? that's a discontinuity in
    space-time.
  - what if the change in states of matter eventually leads to some
    kind of inversion of space (or space-time)
    - (?) as the mass approaches the state of pure energy, it becomes
      more continuous and connected. as this happens, the space
      between is pushed further outward
      - this would appear to an observer as the formation of a
        singularity and the massive distortion of space-time around
        that point, but it's really because the matter dissolves into
        spatial nothingness as the energy density approaches the
        maximum for that region of space-time.
      - even though the singularity doesn't grow in size, the mass
        still accumulates and stays fixes to that point in space, but
        does so as raw energy, which is fluid and continuous (?)
- could a singularity be viewed as another type of space or state of
  space? it's like an inversion of space, in a way, but clearly, its
  singular point. yet, does a singularity have some notion of volume
  that acts as an analog to volume in 3D space?
  - if something like this is true, then how does one map from the
    coordinate system of our spacetime to the coordinate system of the
    inversion of space. it could be a like an anti-bubble floating
    on the surface of a liquid
    - one could map the surface of a liquid to the surface of the
      region of contact on the anti-bubble
    - this analogy could be extended to 3D

### E=mc^2

- is special relativity missing some aspect based on space?
  - i.e. does E=mc^2 actually have a component of space that helps
    account for how mass affects space?
  - the virtual particles above demonstrate a long-term process that
    causes the curviture of space to evaporate as mass radiates away
    from a black hole as energy
  - i'm pretty sure the virtual particles, if real, are coupled to the
    structure/nature of space

### Arrangement of matter inside a singularity

- what is the arrangement of matter "inside" the singularity
- i need to know more about how the virtual particles emerge from a
  singularity, why and when. but i think there's a connection
  between the virtual particles and spacetime.
  - the collision of these virtual particles allows energy to
    evaporate from a blackhole in the form of Hawking radiation
    - this also relieves the stress on the curvature of space imposed
      by the black hole.
    - thus, there's a connection b/w these virtual particles and
      space. at least via energy
  - what special conditions in a black hole cause the virtual
    particles to emerge and what determines the rates at which they
    emerge and the rates at which they collide?
    - how do these particles behave?
    - does this depend on the shape of the spacetime around it?
    - i'd bet that it does & if so, it may be related to the
      reconcilliation of inconsistencies in the disparity of spacetime
      - reconcilliation, like a quantum gravity RAFT algorithm
        with virtual particles
  - this disparity in the view of spacetime emerges in models of
    relativity inspired by DeSitter space, which is difficult to
    reconcile a coherent view of spacetime bc each point "sees" it's
    own version
    - does this mean that there is an infinitely recursive,
      turtles-all-the-way-down reconciliation process that eventually
      gives way to some equilibrium, where the equilibrium is the
      coherent spacetime? that would make the math very difficult.
    - regardless of whether there's need for infinite recursion, then
      the virtual particles may emerge when there is significant
      difference in the reconciled equilibrium spacetime curvature and
      the local variance in perceived spacetime curvatures from each
      point
  - this disparity might increase between two blackholes, which would
    mean that models would show increased frequency of virtual
    particle emergence there (although those situations never last
    long)
    - is there some way of quantizing this disparity? or some
      connection to the Fourier Transform?

### Merger of Singularities

- what happens to the singularities and the space b/w th two black
  holes as they merge together?
  - at some points, the event horizons could merge, like an electron
    cloud in di-hydrogen or di-oxygen
  - the forces of gravity should cancel each other out in between them
    and this should cause the event horizon(s) to shrink (but increase
    somewhat on the opposite side, to significant effect)
    - eventually the
  - it would probably spew out hawking radiation as the binary pair
    merges and disrupts the spacetime between them, so that the
    spacetime can be reconciled and they can be merged.
    - this should be visible as a burst of hawking radiation but
      shifted in ways that are unexpected. probably chaotic in terms
      of spectral content and polarization. a massive amount of
      energy spews out, similar to gamma ray bursts.
    - some of the energy would transform into higher forms of matter,
      like subatomic particles
  - the matter should splurge outward in between the two holes and
    there should be some transition from singularity to
    non-singularity.
  - this burst of virtual particles likely happens anytime that large
    massive objects fall into quasars and supermassive blackholes.
    - but it's probably masked because the conditions in which these
      particles emerge to reconcile the structure of spacetime don't
      resemble those of normal blackholes

- there might be some way to use this to calculate information about
  size/shape/etc of the universe
  - this being the phenomenon of strong space curvatures, such as
    levels seen around black holes or in superclusters.
  - these may contribute in some minor way to a resolution in
    disonnance of strongly curved spacetime by virtualization and
    emission of radiation, leading to a faint shadow in the
    cosmological background radiation at difficult to explain
    frequencies that don't match the CMB from the big bang
    - i donno if it's true, but maybe

    - does it correlate to a dirac sea

# specifics of quantum entanglement based design

- describe the variations in how particles would develop & retain
  entanglement as universe develops past inflation.
  - how is matter distributed in the early universe?
    - it's important because if matter can retain a history of
      entanglement, then it would become more entangled with adjacent
      matter as it expands outwards
      - it could expand as a ring, or a sphere?
      - what does space look like in the center?
      - what happens to that space after inflation?

    - it would become entangled with less and less matter as time goes on
    - once gases merge into stars, those sets of entangled particles
      would become mostly isolated and the history of entanglement
      would be "overwritten" as the newer entanglements are much more
      frequent
      - if the phenomena is possible, then this fact could allow us to
        detect the foreign entanglements from before the matter formed
        a star.

- it would be like two civilizations simultaneously developing *basic*
  radio technology 4000 years ago
  - in otherwords, they simultaneously developed prehistoric ham radios
  - they could come online and they share a common communication
    medium bc of universal language, even though the technology was
    developed in two separate places

- this is a fascinating idea about the radios, but i'm pretty sure it
  never happened ... just to clarify
  - requires a degree of precision in manufacturing parts
    - requires math that didn't exist to explain electromagnetism
    - i.e. maxwell, advanced calculus, etc.
  - requires understanding of targeting a radio signal and designing
    antennae to transmit/receive radio signals
  - more to the point, if this did happen, it would show up in the
    evolution of language and culture.
  - but... if it did happen... that'd be cool.

- protocol would reflect of apex of quantum-entanglement based
  communication.
  - this is bc, if the tech permitted us to instantaneously connect
    with other civilizations within a neighborhood of distance d,
    - and if the tech didn't require physical contact to link
      entangled particles
    - then we could assume that alien civilizations would want to use
      the most efficient/secure/etc networking protocol.
      - it would resolve to some perfect aspect of quantum mechanics,
        like plank length or sequenced on a time period that is exact
        multiples of chronons
    - and because we can assume that there is some universal language
      that emerges from mathematics (reference post), we can also
      assume that aliens would want to use whatever language that is
      to communicate.
      - this further helps them avoid establishing physical contact
        to communicate

- everyone imagines exploring the universe a la star trek, with a
  fleet of majestic space ships. but no. nope. no enterprise.
  - no, were just gonna hang back on earth and kick it. we don't have
    to fight the borg... we'll send them lolcat videos and they'll
    send us cute lolborg videos and memes that say "destroy all
    kitties"

- if everything was entangled... or lots of things...
  - then there would be an other half to the equation
  - that is, everything is connected (or lots of things), so wouldn't
    any effect on one particle dissipate its effects to the rest of
    the entangled particles? and if so, how?
    - couldn't this be used as an "other half" to an equation?
    - but how could it, if you couldn't know that everything was
      connected? and yet, it should be impossible for everything to be
      connected because when matter formed directly after the big
      bang, it couldn't all be adjacent
    - but if some matter is connected on a large scale, how can we
      determine how those large sets overlap? can we average things
      out?

- impossible to discern the origin of the signal (?)
  - location undiscernable.
  - and time? simultaneous. this might produce wierd counter-intuitive
    effects that contrast relativity
    - does this say anything about the nature of space?

### Misc Quantum

- instead of calculating quantum (q or p), can you get a better
  understanding of the system by inferring the actual paths of
  particles through the space?
  - instead of measuring (q or p), infer the path of the particles
    through space by understanding how the paths must cohere to
    curvature constraints to preserve Ĥ (hamiltonian)

### Establishment of Quantum Links in the Minds of People

- is there a protocol for establishing a quantum connection b/w human
  minds through a shared experience? i.e. shared imagery/video
  - this idea assumes that what we see produces data images within our
    minds, where the data images share similar signals
    - so, if web of quantum entanglement interconnects all
      consciousnesss on earth, then if a similar enough signal emerges
      in two minds simultaneously, can this be used to establish some
      kind of quantum connection?
    - and what if this was a visual image cast into two people
      simultaneously using split photons, could the data of the mental
      image be guaranteed to share similar enough form to
- if not for the establishment of a link via quantum entanglement,
  could a similar process be used for the establishment of various
  information processing patterns in the minds of initiates
  - this is similar to various occult techniques

### Dispersion of gravity waves

- Dispersion of gravity waves compared to sound/light
  - does dispersion of photons affect frequency & amplitude?
    - a gravity wave must affect the momentum and positioning of
      photons traveling along with a gravity wave.
  - what does the amount of dispersion of photons tell us about the
    quantum nature of gravity?
    - or the structure of space?
- the observed gravity wave(s) by LIGO ... do we really know where
  they came from? bc I'm pretty sure we don't
  - did we identify the binary blackhole source beforehand? or have we
    identified it since?
- can we observe experimental evidence of how the field of gravity
  changes when dispersal is altered by velocity of a mass?
  - (?) if you can model the changes in the field effect of gravity
    due to velocity, it should be possible to derive the speed of
    light
  - if mass interferes with the flow of gravity waves, what does that
    say about the nature of mass/energy/space?
- what happens to the dispersion of a gravity wave that travels
  through a large black hole?
  - does it's effect/energy/quanta get dispersed or scattered
    according to the curvature of space?
- a more advanced LIGO experiment should be able to perform
  hyperspectral analysis of a gravity wave and really understand the
  effects mass would have on it's propagation
  - MASS ABSOLUTELY MUST AFFECT A GRAVITY WAVE. IT MUST LOSE ENERGY
  - however, because a gravity wave has so much energy, it must be
    difficult to measure, but an advanced in-space LIGO experiment
    should be able to detect some of this with hyperspectral analysis

- for a gravity wave radiating away from A, what happens to the space
  distortion in between B & C as D grows larger and larger?

```
     C

   / |

 /   |
A    d

```

### Nature of Gravity (& Misc)

- it seems that mass is the inversion of space and gravity is the
  change in shape bc of its displacement. i've had this impression for
  a long time (possibly already covered it in the gravity blog)
  - there should be a triumverate of mass/space/energy
    - there should be some relationship whereby each can be converted
      to the other. (or at least, each can be defined in terms of the
      other two)
    - E=(mc^2) may have a spatial component
  - but i have no fucking clue because i can't derive special
    relativity or do reimann math or w/e...

- a symmetric object of sufficient size would not necessarily appear
  to be symmetric, especially with distorted space
  - and especially if moving.

- if space is a fluid, then the speed of light is like the terminal
  velocity, but why? why is it so absolute?
  - if it's caused by some mechanism, & that mechanism is physical,
    that implies that:
    - (1) the existence of a sub-medium (something below space)
    - (2) and an altered speed of light is possible
      - (?) yet the things that need to be altered should be similarly
        distorted (wtf?)

- (probably stupid) but it should be fairly simple to tell whether an
  altered speed of light is possible because of interdependencies in
  the Standard Model:
  - if the speed of light can be numerically obtained, then it is not
    possible to have an altered speed of light
  - if the value for C (speed of light) can only be obtained after
    experiementally observed values are obtained, then an altered
    speed may be possible under different spatial constraints

- does all matter/mass contributed to the curvature of space evenly?
  - gravity as the effect of energy on space

### Gomboc & EMP dispersion

- Gomboc concept applied to an EMField with magnets/electromagnets
  where the field is shaped so that electrons entering the field are
  redirected to specific positions circuits
  - i.e. no matter what direction EMP radiation enters the Gomboc
    field, it will always be pushed towards circuits with adequate
    voltage regulation, so that there is never a risk of overloaded
    circuitry
- the question here is: are there such shapes to EM fields that can
  enable this special functionality or sufficiently approximate it to
  guarantee EMP survival of cubesats or other satellites in space

### Gravity Crystal X Gomboc

- [Time Crystals](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/03/researchers-present-time-crystals-made-of-quantum-mechanical-oscillations/)

- gravity crystals X gomboc structure for a theoretical whitehole
  - gomboc is a structure where, no matter how it is placed, it will
    always eventually rest in the same position
  - so there could be such a massive theoretical structure that, no
    matter which direction something enters and regardless of its
    momentum, it is always ejected at near light speed
  - does such a structure exist? if so, it would almost certainly be a
    structure that only temporarily satisfies such properties
  - it would probably borrow heavily from the ideas of gravity
    crystals in order to maintain such structure and properties
  - such a structure may be required to be massive to harness gravity
    waves in order to achieve it's properties ... somehow lulz
- but basically, it's an arrangement of masses that are able to
  sustain their structure while simulating a weak white hole.
  - possibily relying on the speed of gravity propagating through
    space to delay the propagation of energy.
  - i really can't even imagine what this thing would look like

### Cosmic evolution

- how has the apperance of the cosmos change over millions of years?
  - how does the path of a ray of light change due to the effect of
    gravity? how does gravity's affect aggrgate/accumulate over vast
    distances and is its effect changed by the influence of curved
    space?
    - (OMFG I think i've added this same question fourteen times!)
  - if so, how could such a force possibly respect the law of the
    conservation of energy? there should be some characteristic
    distortion in the dispersal of gravity's energy & effect on
    spacetime curvature. it should differ from the idealized
    distortion predicted by the standard model because gravity acts on
    spacetime and spacetime influences movement of mass. but there
    should be distortion in the dispersion of gravities energy in
    order for it to adhere to the conservation of energy
    - Noether's theorum & symmetries (and general th. relative)
      - what was i thinking here?

### Ideas on gravity from imagining directional antennae attenuation

(mostly pointless)

- is the energy emitted by a directional antennae proportional to or
  dependent on the volume? (no it's not)
  - for a pointlike directional antenna, it should radiate photons at
    equivalent speeds, but emits more in some directions than others.
  - i've already written about this
- however, do large black holes have a similar effect seen in the
  attenuation of gravity? (i don't think so)
  - if so, how could we possibly measure that?

### lots of questions on gravity

- how could a singularity not have shape if mass can be added to it?
  when mass is attached to the singularity, what is the shape/velocity
  of the mass? (this is fairly well understood)
  - how does a mass's effect on other masses change w/ velocity,
    especially as it approaches a singularity

- the reason that poisson's law applies to electromagnetism and
  gravity is because they are both field-like (?)
  - what similarities are shared and why does relativity cause gravity
    to be expressed differently?
    - that is, gravity is monopolar whereas electromagnetism is
      bipolar
- does the path of neutrinos curve? are there masses too small for
  gravity to affect? (NO ... spacetime curves)

- HOW DOES GRAVITY AFFECT THE TRAJECTORY OF HIGG'S BOSON?
  - and if gravity affects the trajectory of higg's bosons, how does
    that alter it's field affect
    - and, in particular, how does that affect its change in field
      "shape" over time
      - especially in high energy displacements
      - e.g. merging of two large masses
        - 2 singularities
        - 1 singularity and one large mass
        - two large masses (no singularities)

- for every point in spacetime, is the distortion simply the sum of
  gravity from other masses? (i think i asked this in my blog on
  gravity)
  - if so, then an infinity gravitational crystal would experience no
    net force from its nodes' masses, as long as those nodes remain
    equidistant and in infinite repetition and space
  - actually, i still can't conceptualize any perfectly stable gravity
    crystals due to the propagation time of gravity. (for either
    finite or infinite gravity crystals)
- what gravity crystal shapes are possible? how do the nature of these
  crystals differ from that of traditional crystals?
  - specifically, how does time influence the possible crystal shapes?
  - are there finitely many enumerable crystal families? (like there
    are platonic solids)

- 2 masses moving away from each other will eventually cease to affect
  each other. the effect of gravity from the mass can't propagate in
  time and eventually wanes faster than the distance squared.
  - why is this?
    - is the space between still affected?

- if the unsolved problems of general relativity are mostly bc it's a
  differential eq initial values problem:
  - then is there some way to numerically train an algorithm to find
    more acceptable or more natuaral initial values?

- how do we measure the speed of light? and why is it so tightly
  coupled to the laws of nature?
  - is the value of the speed of light numerically defined in the
    universe? that is, does the actual value of C arise purely from
    numerics? or does resolving the speed of light require
    dependencies obtained from experimentation?

=============

Astronomy as a means for recognizing reincarnation ... somehow
- but... how?
- more of astrology for recognizing reincarnation: if someone is born
  in the northern hemisphere and travels to the southern hemisphere
  and already has knowledge of their myths/signs
  - ... definitely not scientific

### Answers to Fermi's Paradox

So... There are many answers out there to Fermi’s paradox. One of
those answers is that we’re looking for emission of radiation. It
turns out that radiation emission from a planet may only last a few
hundred years because there’s a much more efficient technology out
there.

Also, I believe there might be some kind of Quantum Web, coupled with
both a universal language and universal quantum networking
protocol. The existence of these things would allow us to tap into a
cosmic internet, powered by a local supercluster party-line and
communicate without energy, for free. This would allow us to
communicate at faster than the speed of light and transfer
consciousness across the cosmos into awaiting android bodies, without
the need to travel.

Bad news: energy demands are still high for local life though, so
we’ll still need Dyson Spheres. More bad news: no epic Star Trek
journeys. Nope. Well, OK maybe, but not really. We wouldn’t need
to. Once we connect with all those other civilizations, we can fork
our consciousness to epic space bodies and have freeky alien sex and
there’s probably a lot of tentacles involved.... more is better,
amirite?

### Galactic ethics 4 time travel

Galaxy where a federation permits cultures to perform time travel
a limited number of times

- because to contain it requres containing the butterfly effect
- so someone has to do that & counterbalance the effects
- therefore, bc the butterfly effect needs to be contained,
  - to allow societies to fix their shit without too much affect on
    the universe as a whole (because large gravitational/EMR
    disturbances cause large changes that ripple outwards)
  - it also is not permitted after the culture breaks through the oort
    cloud.
- basically, your civilization gets a few extra lives before it breaks
  through to travel between systems
  - this one's completely hypothetical and probably not true. mostly a
    scifi plot device

### Misc ideas

- periodic table as an emergent structure based on physics and math
  - the parallels b/w this and the wierd quantum mechanics sums from
    analytic combanatorics (taylor's ??? see depiction)
  - are there parallels b/w the periodic table and polynomial
    expansions or ... this is kind of a dumb idea

- "plank length" for the curvature of space. are there discrete
  minimum or discrete maximums in the curvature of space that result
  from the plank length?
  - is there some minimum amount above zero for curvature of space
  - is there some identifyable quality of the curvature space that
    results from the plank length?
    - {this only occurs if the plank length results in some kind of
      discrete structure of space at a very low level. i'm pretty sure
      it doesn't}
    - but if this plank-curvature exists, then is there a disparity
      that emerges at larger scales resulting from the dissonance in
      curvature of space and the energy required to curve it?
      - so if curvature of space has some kind of "discreteness" to
        it, then at larger scales, that should manifest as distortion
        in the amount of energy required to curve space
        - if it does, it will be extremely small
