### application of art to these philosophical ideas:

#### social physics

    - sociophysical circuits (and superimposition of topologies)
    - holon/holonome & information as particle, w/ wave/particle
      duality
    - entanglement of iotas/datums (& collapse of kantian categories)

#### spectral decoherence of information/semiotics

    - the intersection of this idea with kantian categories
      - i.e. if the variety/quantity of information expands
        exponentially, while any two individuals' history of
        information consumption simultaneously diverges
        - the set of information

      - but this trend creates ... ?
  - evolution from ... ? thanks alot ADD

  - misc:

#### ante-modernism

- (refer to draft on ephemeral nature of linguistic evolution)

#### "social-neuro-linguistic"

with requirements for development of language and the explosion of
neural development that occurs after social behavior encourages
consensus of abstraction. all of these factors feed back into
themselves and result in the development of language


## Structure of information as memes, datums, iotas

#### **Meme(s)** a monoidal information-type that can be expressed to produce a datum, a unit of information.

- important to state that these definitions are for modeling
  information metaphysically

By making memes monoidal, it implies three kinds of behaviors. First,
given nothing: it expresses a datum representing the meme structure.
Second, the meme can contain additional structure that describes how
it should transform input. Third, the meme can accept input that
describes how it should transform the other components of the
input. In this way, it represents itself with an expressable datum
that also encodes its normal expression behavior, which can be
externally modulated.

#### **Datum(s)** a unit of information.

The expression of a meme produces a datum.

Datum structures without values

- are instanceless because they already exist from a combinatorial
  expansion
  - i can understand how to combinatorially generate a set of category
    structures where the objects are undefined. each member of this
    set could be a monoid that generates an instance of category by
    providing instantiations of its objects (e.g. sets) and morphisms
    (e.g. set mutations.
  - this combinatorially generated set of category structures is
    countable (afai can see)
    - it is generated from a very small set of information
  - but what i wanted was to map iotas, instances of the information,
    to pregenerated datums, so that all possible forms of information
    can be shown to already pre-exist
  - another problem is that the structure of each morphism depends on
    the mutated objects.

Datums can be visualized as graphs, but are modeled on categories with
objects and morphisms, which are also objects. The benefit here is a
finite set of primative datums can be combinatorially generated from a
finite set

#### **Iota(s)** an instance of a datum.


- the

- a datum is a piece of information, where equality to some other
  datum is not necessarily dependent on the instance.
- a datum can be made into a meme by making some part of it mutable.
  - in this way, the meme is a type that generates
- a meme has a datum representing itself

#### Peak Post-Modernism

![peak post modernism picture]()

- from the definition of the noosphere, define a spectral
  understanding of information (spectrum of information)
  - meta-modernism
    - people are trying to stand out more and more.
    - cyclic interplay b/w post/modernism

#### structure of series:

  - content from other drafts?
    - create/push branch with a copy of the current parapets drafts in
      tact before i cannabalize it
    - parapets part two:
      - section on hip hop
      - section on data science and black lives matter?
    - parapets part 4:
      - a ton about social media & algorithms
      - part 3 is mostly not relevant
    - peace-power-prosperity (possibly a few valuable snippets)

- describe information economics and how the medium of transmission
  affects supply/demand
- references to a grimoire for an analogy to old ideas becoming more
  visible

####

#### Part Two: Social Physics

1. (reuse segment from parapet-2 on thermopylae, etc as intro?)
2. discribe how information reverberates around the world
   - some basic ideas, such as social connectivity and the economic
     benefits. minimum/maximum of connectivity in today's world
3. overview of basic concepts of social physics, along with
   everyday examples
   - the most important conclusions from understanding social
     physics
   - how telecom/internet changes social physics
4. informal postulates of social physics.
   - most critical inferences from social physics
   - definition of power as the potential to trigger flux
   - mechanics of power
5. physical analogies
   - people as particles: temperature, density, state, etc.
   - speed of sound
   - phase changes
   - configurational entropy & conformational entropy

#### Part Three: geometry and mechanics of information

- thesis: how the geometry and structure of information affects its
  diffusion.
  - the specifics of datums, the spectrum of info,
  - the capacity of information to persist, replicate, be quantified,
    be compared to, be equated with, etc.

    - the structure of information (semiotics, linguistics, etc)
    - "mechanical" aspects of information
      - the language it's written in might cause it to move in
        different ways
      - the specific ideas it concerns might similarly determine
        "motion"
     - the information warfare content i outlined after writing the fb
       post

#### part four: future evolution of information (metaphys. precip.)

    1. metaphysical precipitation
    2. start with warning on how tech leads to a breakdown in how
      people and autonomous agents understand cause & effect
    - other, higher level philosophical insights

- thesis for part four:
  - complexity of information dynamics in a converged world leads to a
    breakdown in causality
  - use imagery from that anime on the anisotropic


- we need to focus on how those fundamentals of
  communication/information, in the context of convergence/etc

- (this leads to drastically different conclusions on what humanity's
  purpose is and what our challenges are)

Humanity needs to identify and magnify its common ground. Law and
action should... promote incentivization.

We all have to own this, wherever it leads. Pain from past and present
conflict threatens to motivate future tension.

Systems with properly structured incentivization models always
reinforce


  - blinded by our ego
  - information saturation & overstimulation
  - individuality/privacy is diminished
  - causality becomes incredibly difficult to understand

###

- Social physics is not scientific.
  - (when is it not scientific?!)
    - it's hard to distinguish S/Phys & social media data science
  - Any formulation is theoretic at best, since most applications are
    incomputable and most quantities are not measurable.
  - It's hard to draw a line between social physics and data science
    via social media analytics,
    - social data science and machine learning is proficient, assuming
      optimal UI design, optimally regular usage, etc.
    - however, it breaks down with adversarial signals.
    - many of the problems we experienced in 2016 can be solved, when
      you can resolve identity with greater confidence.
  - social media is not the problem. it is partly how people are
    learning to use social media, coupled with changes in
    phenom. implications of sociophysics

part one:
===============

- add photos of new gender/sexuality spectrums to first part
  - this is an example of spectral decoherence and hurts the LGBTQ
    communities because it impairs the brandability of all sexual
    identities
    - in order for their movement to be strong and create long-lasting
      changes, they need for almost everyone in their movement to
      relate to a handful of sexual identities: LGBTQ
    - if instead there are 100+ identities, it becomes harder to
      consistently and strongly brand the identies. each one has less
      following. it causes the movement's energy to be diffused.
