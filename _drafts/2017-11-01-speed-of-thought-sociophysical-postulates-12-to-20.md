- macrame/ta'veryn connection (the wheel of time: the web is like the
  series of possibilities and it's shape is similar to that of
  high-dimensional convergent knots)

#### Multiplicity of Karmic Consequences

- everything is all one. all events and karmic course of
  action. everything is one. so, its' impossible to know the course of
  events that lead to specific consequences and impossible to know the
  consequences from a single event, no matter how simple that event
  may seem.
  - and so no event is as simple as it seems within the small time
    window or contextual window that it's viewed within. this is what
    liberals fundamentally do not understand.
  - they see a problem and they are marginally intelligent: enough to
    think they know the answer is the opposite of the problem. they
    are so predictable
  - whereas usually, the root cause of the problem has very little to
    do with the myriad of problems that are created. so if you attack
    all those problems one by one, you create myriad consequences. if
    you instead attack the problem at its ROOT and pull that weed out,
    it never even grows back
    - magically, all the rest of those problems STOP, because the
      actor who keeps setting them in motion because they INTEND to
      create war, desire, famine, etc for PROFIT no longer exists.
  - also the "cliffs notes version" metaphor is a perfect way of
    summing that up. we tell the story we want to tell and teach what
    we want to teach, without regard for its truth or its omissions
  - then later people have a lot of questions or an overeagerness to
    placate any dissent to the official story

- so you see, knowledge of social physics in itself can lead to some
  pretty dark places. this is the inspiration for alchemy and this
  series is effectively a post-doctoral masterpiece on methodological
  alchemy.

- if the idea of God cannot be proven or can be proven false, is there
  still value for religion? (of course)
- is there a fundamental truth for determining moral reality? moral
  ground truth?

  adhere to it?
- does the idea of God cause sociophysical events to become more
  deterministic?
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism & the ablation of
  causality

- secret societies seek to turn social physics into a "closed system"
  by assessing each node's information-set and belief-set, utilizing
  its network to distribute information about people
  - these societies, which are both good or evil, are interested in
    qualitatively assessing people's ethics.
    - the group then interacts with boundaries of the social
      neighborhood and can leverage information from people's ethical
      assessment to influence what happens and exercise control
  - the construction of a network with people who have invisible
    puppet strings.

- math ideas
  - "K curve" for estimating speciation
    - gene replication vs belief/informational replication

- social physics &#x8855; demographic stratification of children by
  age through childhood and adolescence (used for psychological
  programming)

- dandelion imagery
  - ancient magus anime (episode 5)
  - high level blurb, prompting reader to envision imagery
  - planting seeds, watching them grow
    - different methods of seed creation/content/motion
    - statistical understanding (energy required to create each seed
      vs likelihood of success in short/long term)
      - dandelions vs acorns (how many need to replicate, life cycle
        of each plant, how many could possibly replicate)
      - potential/need for synergy b/w plant & animal species based on
        the above characteristics (life cycle, reproduction, specific
        qualities of phenotypes)
        - an oak tree has a long life cycle. alone, no matter how many
          acorns are produced, it can't expect to produce another
          reproducing member of its species. over-populated forest and
          flat terrain contain the species (ability/range of
          reproduction)
  - how do these concepts apply to social physics, if the seed is an
    iota/datum of information?
    - ... plant life cycle analogies
    - information (replicates), but doesn't necessarily reproduce.
      - however, information *always* reproduces some portion of
        itself when it replicates.
        - this is because all information is similar to all other
          information in some way (it all descends and ascends
          infinitely -- all is one, one is all)

#### Social Physics (X) (Pathological Liars & Disinformation)

- Pathologically-oriented motivations behind lying, especially
  compulsive lying
  - for a smokescreen, for mapping information networks, for tracing
    information through social networks
  - ... other reasons?

- the above () seen in pathological liars is often useful in
  for situations of greater social scale
  - but hard to justify and with the risk that you lose credibility,
    which is difficult to accumulate (and easy to lose)
  - it's useful primarily for the ability to trace information through
    networks (by tagging a story/fact/statement with several
    "catching" nonce components)
    - but you can usually only do this when it's disinformation or
      misinformation. if a nonced component (is true), it may still be
      resolved by others if they resolve it on their on via the
      coherence of the information.
    - there are many uses for this in technology and IRL
  - since people play telephone all the time, by attaching nonce
    components to stories, you can begin to get a feel for who is
    talking to who.

#### Just Like The Body Follows The Head...

- just like the body follows the head, both the individual and the
  social organism follow the projection of attention, in aggregate.
  where there is aggregate attention, there will be motion towards and
  away from the object of focus. where there is change in aggregate
  attention, there will be change in motion and direction of motion,
  towards and away from the spatially distributed changes.
  - this applies to abstract notions of space, location, direction,
    and motion. to understand this, think about how you might measure
    attention on social networks and imagine what the notion of a
    space means for social networks.
  - explain the sociophysical differences between "Attention" and
    "Parade Rest" as an example to demonstrate how you should follow
    the logical, higher-order direction of focus instead of simply
    gauging someone's head/eye orientation

#### The Prototypical Thought Experiment for S/Phys (w/ both Phys+Virtual)

- Your target uses Google Maps. You know the address they searched &
  entered. You know they are en route now and can monitor their
  current position, along with the time remaining.
- you need to filter your social graph to the set of people various
  conjunctions of you and your target's 1&deg; and 2&deg; social
  neighborhoods.
  - (i.e. your mutual friends is the conjunction of your
    1&deg; neighborhoods)
  - furthermore, you'll need to sort your mutual neighborhood results
    by many params AND/OR by distance to target.
  - assume you can access the real social graph, regardless of how
    your data is composed of many virtual sources)

#### The Perfect (Recipe) for Cooking Eggs (a complex application of the Heat Equation)

- IRL of probabilistic system with state transformations: cooking eggs
  with and without oil
  - this relates to the heat equation, but one who's endogenous and
    exogenous heat characteristics are strongly warped by the chemical
    composition
  - thus, the heat propagation characteristics are altered by system
    phase changes (less grease == faster rate of heat-consuming
    reactions bc of less heat radiation absorption & diffusion with
    grease)
  - on a skillet, the heat is then diverted to driving a small number
    of chemical reactions along the boundary where chemical reactions
    are occuring
    - because the heat is chemically consumed along phase change
      boundaries and because the change-in-phase-change is limited
      (convexly?) to a local region of space, then the food burns
- think of reactions in social physics like cooking food. in the
  presence of some ingredients, then:
  - phase changes are either spatially contained (locally convex?)
  - or not (phase change dynamics are locally concave and the system
    is highly turbulent)
  - what are the facets for convexity/concavity in driving local phase
    change dynamics?
  - phenomenologically, how does this translate to sociopolitical
    games? people like cooking with grease (they like artificially
    inducing predictable change)
    - conversely, they like restricting change whose phase change
      dynamics are predictable -- OR AT LEAST SEEM TO BE

#### Examples of geographic chokepoints:

  - khyber pass (silk road & afganistan)
  - isthmus surrounding istanbul and the channel of water connecting
    the black/marmara seas
    - this pair acts as both a land and sea chokepoint
  - the strait of gibraltar, connecting "inner" mediterranean and
    north africa with the "outer" northwestern europe
  - the sinai peninsula
  - the panama isthmus (the middle east of mesoamerica -- the most
    geographically connected area for those continents)

- information flows with and against commerce/trade/movement
  - commerce/trade (& what else) flows with and against information

- modeling sociophysical information dispersion and chokepoints from
  geographic data
  - this builds on some of what is mentioned in the previous section:
    - energy from the sun not only causes heat to diffuse through
      physical systems, but it is at least correlated to "heat"
      diffusion through sociophysical systems
  - it's connected to the above high-dimensional application of the
    heat equation (with phase transitions)
  - geographic features and weather patterns then become critical for
    regulating heat transfer across the face of the earth. and thus
    regulating diffusion of information and commerce
    - some areas are well connected, others are completely isolated
      (except to various means of transportation)
      - every point on the map has many paths connecting it to the
        points in its neighborhood (this may connect to euclidean path
        integrals, but with more subtleties that model multiple modes
        of transit along with the features of those modes (limited
        capacity/vehicles or ports/docking))
    - there are some elements of what i thought was an "expander
      graph" except recomposed for a "continuous" graph (a space where
      subtleties of the connectedness of the space are taken into
      account)
      - that is, areas containing a chokepoint are more valueable, but
        not if many chokepoints are nearby because that increases the
        cost to maintain/operate/defend/control each chokepoint (like
        a mountain pass)
      - these chokepoints may be defined variously, but one such
        method is finding areas of the map where there is mostly high
        topographical variance in a point's neighborhood, but not in
        the immediate vicinity of the point itself.
        - see [Spectral Graph Theory]() section on a discrete version
          of Cheegar's Inequality
        - also, see the continuous version of [Cheeger's
          Inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheeger_constant#Cheeger.27s_inequality),
          which is a metric of connectedness of manifolds/spaces in
          Reimannian Geometry
        - however, Cheeger's number/inequalities are metrics of the
          total graph. i want something similar for a
          ball/neighborhood moving over and expanding over the graph.


### Intro(?)

- mention quantum physics and coarse graining
  - explain "what" coarse graining really is and why we may be wrong
    about quantum mechanics. explain why the Ansatz and Tensor
    Networks explain these phenomena under dimensionally various
    conceptions of the problem statement
  - Connect to Simon Dedeo's video (part 1)

- over the course of thousands of years, elites (needed to understand)
  social physics and statistics to rule/manage people. modern man
  presumes mathematic insights from chemistry, thermodynamics and
  (...?) certainly must have eluded our ancestors.
  - over the past two centuries, technology has tucked away
    the former complexities of:
    - agrarian life
    - (life w/o communication)

  - so we don't understand the problems our minds addressed in those
    eras, without any efficient communication methods.
    - before the renaissance, Western technology had not hit a
      critical mass required to facilitate rapid technological
      advancement
    - prior to industrialization, the means of production were bounded
      by the economies of scale associated to labor in particular.
      - anything and everything produced required many manhours
    - almost any skill/occupation/activity involved inefficient
      communication/logistic processes, where usage/anticipation of
      time was as (paramount) as redundancy and mitigation of
      unknowns/externalities.
      - these people couldn't buy butter at the grocery store

- semioteleologically, through engagement in cultural activities
  requiring more flexible, rigorous, & total utilization of the wider
  population's cognitive skills, this means people would begin to
  intuitively reapply patterns/ideas from trades & skills to other
  areas
  - since they engaged in these trades/skills in fundamentally
    different ways (.. contrast with modern work)
    - they would develop intuitionalized means of understanding
      individual or recurring phenomena in various skills/crafts
      - over the course of someone's life they would developxs an
        individualized construction of knowledge, without need for
        scientific method or proof. they might never understand
        precisely *how* phenomena correlated to one another as they
        did, but they would try to understand *why*
      - in the process of doing so, the would develop intui
      - also esotericized means of...

- as for these esotericized methods of passing down information,
  - the true intended insight imparted by (rituals) would be
    occasionally lost, recovered or arbitrarily mutated.
    - if this period of (ambiguous meaning) for some ritual/insight
      became protracted
  - events incredibly disruptive to the preservation of culture were
    more common and more total.


- one of the most important crafts has always been management and
  leadership. for the ruling class to manage their affairs and appear
  as though they might have God-like wisdom, they needed to use
  statistics and math.
  - this knowledge, the actual extent of which is impossible to know,
    would be masked by constant inundation: intentional
    disinformation, superstitional misinformation, etc
  - it would almost certainly avoid being recorded on stone &
    metalwork.
  - other profoundly useful insights from which one develops
    understandings of mathematic concepts from physics, chemistry,
    (and others) -- is social physics
    - however, they would only form intuitions about these phenomena,
      the form of which would be:
      - reasoned about through visual images and metaphor to perceived
        phenomena (especially from work, agriculture, music
        (harmonics), etc)
      - where these images/myths would be preserved symbolically
        through myth

- natural signs/phenomena are some of the most powerful means of
  developing an understanding of
  - even to someone devoid of writing, the natural world itself is
    full of information about nature. if you truly know natural
    phenomena, you need only look around and you see physics, math,
    biology, chemistry, etc everywhere
  - but it appears in a totally different manner
    - the gradient manifests itself everywhere in the natural
      world. everywhere. you don't need to know what it is to
      understand how the essence of the phenomenon of gradual
      change over space and through matter is incredibly relevant
    - fluid dynamics also manifests itself everywhere. look at the
      ripples on the surface of a creek with fairly stable fluid
      flow patterns
      - in order to model these patterns, you need 3D FFT(?) along
        with differential equations that preserve the
        regional/global volume flux (L/s) and variance in flux
        (L/s^2) over time, while accounting for subtle fluid
        dynamics forces
  - in medicine, the gradient and fluid flow in the body are
    incredibly important for understanding local changes to the body
    - ancient people couldn't quantify or measure much of anything and
      were cursed by superstition
    - (discuss Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine)

- {where? intro?} emphasize that the only way to predict social
  behavior in todays world is by proactively driving patterns of
  behavior
  - so, everything is hopelessly incomputable and can't be modeled. in
    spite of that, proactive tactics can make social networks more
    predictable.
    - but because of adversarial dynamics driven by game theory,
      influential groups struggle to signal over networks to
      proactively drive behavior and can cause the system to become
      unpredictable in ways that can't be predicted...

To anticipate flow of energies in sociophysical circuits, especially
with n-phase oscillation and multi-energy transductions, one must
develop methods for recognizing, interpolating and inferring
representations of deconstructed dynamics in chaotic sociophysical
systems.

Briefly described in [Awareness Precipitates from Order Out Of
Chaos](/posts/2017-09-14-awareness-precipitates-from-order-out-of-chaos.html),
these

Programmatic chaotic systems like genetics or social physics, is
briefly described . These "signatures" are key to pattern recognition
of toxic social or financial behavior, when any specific pattern
itself would be uselessly singular if effable. Effective actors will
always seek to elude or deceive, regardless of their intent. Also,
towards operating in an environment like this, the mimicry or tactical
recomposition of these deconstructed energetic dynamics is necessary
for coordinated strategy.

  - this ultimately serves to highlight cognizance of intent
- however, when there are competing sets/structures of information
  (which cannot all be true), with large skews in distribution of
  these datums and iota, some datums can be crowded out.

#### Parallel, Anti-Parallel and Orthoganal Coupling In Motion Towards The Attainment of Equilibrium Unveils Nearly All Deception

- someone with a goal in mind will tend to move *TOWARDS* or *AWAY*
  from that goal when signalling. if they don't feel the need to
  deceive you, they won't fake you out by amplifying signal that
  conveys moving AWAY from some intended area of equilibrium
  - someone clever will move *AROUND* (orthogonally to) the objective
- someone who lacks an agenda or with few goals will exhibit something
  like brownian motion extended to these high-dimensional spaces
  - there is little intentional motion or it's clear to see they are
    concerned about their own life. their behavior isn't highly or
    loosely coupled to you
  - duplicitously justified behavior, random behavior and proactive
    behavior is critical to winning these high-dimensional,
    (poorly-defined) sociophysical games
    - that is, this adversary will deconstruct their strategies into
      duplicities tactics. they will smash their intent and strategy
      into fragments and shards, then force their will into agents
      they control,
      - who are ideally acting zealously or righteously towards the
        attainment of these fragments
      - these agents are encouraged to compete vigorously
      - these agents often do not or can't see through the duplicity
      - {i talk about duplicity in the next situation}
    - in order to win, you play both sides against one another {??}
      vigorously, deconstructing your plan into pieces, avoiding the
      need to even deflect causal inference by making everything a lie
      - when someone starts getting close to the truth, the stark
        contrast between that truth and the sea of disinformation
        gives you the smoke that indicates fire

- transition from discussing the methodical high-dimensional
  characterization of behavior to discussing identification,
  stratification, & etc of equilibria as resources
  - once you know where someone intends to go, it becomes much simpler
    to put their words/actions/behavior into context
    - in other words, their motion along (high-dimensional surfaces)
      becomes much easier to place into context and understand
      qualitatively

- overwatch analogy: *get on the point*
  - the point is the objective. when you know the point, you know your
    enemy's destination. if you place yourself at the point, you are
    going to be targeted and thus, the next questions: from which
    angle is the attack going to present itself and which paths lead
    to each angle of attack.
  - if your personal goal for the season is to increase DPS for a
    high-damage, non-support character, get yourself on the point and
    wait. when there's no enemies approaching, navigate the
    path-neighborhood close to the point until you find potential
    sources of DPS
  - to me, overwatch is interesting because of the dynamic of DPS vs
    Alt-Charging. it's not simply the damage you do, but the inverse
    (the damage enemies do) also impacts the outcome of the game in
    more ways than simply your time-out when respawning.
    - even though its far from realistic, the impacts to strategy from
      dps-vs-alt add depth to both to the game and the metagame

- The "OP" as a means of self-censorship and censorship by groupthink
  - it's very annoying to have people get off point, especially when
    they're trying to derail a discussion. but it's also annoying to
    have people "police" the OP.
    - for social norms, extreme compulsion for adherence to and
      deviation from them can ...
      - social norms can be used. sociopaths are notorious for "using"
        the system, including the procedures or subtleties of
        society's institutions and the unwritten rules of social norms
  - some people have reach on social media. others don't..
    - everyone gains value when the discussion stays on point. that's
      obvious.
      - however, by limiting the informational range of the discussion
        and the direction or spectral content of arguments,

- another overwatch point (move to different article)
  -

- application of a resources-oriented mindset
  - (is there an official name for this?)
    - explore Jominian vs. Clauswitzian mindsets with regard to this
      specifically.
      - in the jominian view, these resources are critical to the
        geometry of your force-projection.
        - this is more useful to understanding the short-term effects
          on the conflict and both your enemies ability to operate and
          necessary reactions to continue operations.
      - in the clauswitzian view, these resources form the basis for
        moreso long-term effects, some of the most important of which
        are effects that last decades.
        - in this view, you wage conflict to achieve specific
          effects. there are many ways to get there and they vary
          along many lines: in effectiveness, in efficiency, in their
          quality.

  - To me, my friends and my adversaries, what are my resources and
    what is the value of each?
  - what paths are available to obtaining these resources?
    - i.e. what options are there?
  - in cyberwar, this is an effective high-level approach to modeling
    defense in spite of the obfuscation of an offense.
    - it doesn't matter how your enemy reaches your resources. what
      matters is that they do.
    - it doesn't matter where they come and how they get there,
      whether they delegate via botnet, whether an attack signature is
      mitigated by obfuscation via botnet, they are coming for what
      is needed or considered valuable, regardless of whether its you
      or them.
  - depending on their intent, desire and need to attain/(destroy)
    resources, in some circumstances, it is more efficient offensively
    to present yourself to your enemy directly, so you can limit the
    number of paths they will take to reach you.
    - in this context, i reference paths both in the literal physical
      sense and the metaphorical sense
    - but if you choose this tactic, be prepared for a fight. your
      only advantage is that you know that you will be where they are
      going.

When Unattached To Sociophysical Equilibria, Our Energy Becomes Trackless, Formless and Incomprehensible To The Unconscionable.](#whether-cognizant-nearly-all-attach-their-behavior-thoughts-and-identity-to-equilibria-in-social-games)

- content from "facets: systems-theory"
  - this content is poorly outlined. where else do i have this?
- this section is mostly about leveraging physics/math concepts to
  proactively provoke potential adversaries to reveal & attempt to
  conceal information, including their intent
  - it builds on those sections

#### Equilibrium and Intended Equilibrium

- identifying equilibria and intended equilibria
  - to what ends does someone invest their energy?
  - do they stop once they reach it?
  - are they direct about it? or do they distract you with an overt
    goal, while they truly seek some other goal?

- common equilibria include "ideals" like minima/maxima & saddle
  points of surfaces
  - this section should potentially be moved (to which section?)
    - it makes a lot more sense once the ideas of sociophysical
      metrics is identified in the next part.
  - how many of these minima/maxima/ideals are attained
    simultaneously/sequentially by individuals/groups?
    - are similar common equilibria points targeted by some group of
      individuals?
    - the exact minima/maxima of surfaces *and* motion directly
      towards/away from them are "less likely"
      - *unless* you can assume intentionality

#### Stasis of Equilibria

- what balance of equilibria do people seek?
- once they believe feel they have achieved some particular set of
  equilibria, how do they reorient their energy?
  - some feel satisfied and stop chasing any objective, only beginning
    again when they feel they've lost the equilibria they attained.
  - some move on to the next objectives
  - some never feel satisfied with attaining anything and mercilessly
    strive on.

![Double Door Logic Paradox](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/)

#### Simple Distinguishing Factor Underlying Human Behavior

- the behavior you need to watch for is when an adversary compels some
  sociophysical system to attain particular equilibria, while they
  hide these same objectives.
  - they will prefer to not attract attention to causing the system to
    evolve towards these equilibria
  - if they are (skilled), then to confuse you, they signal with
    antiparallel motion away from the points of equilibria
    - if they do this, they will also interject random motion into the
      system pushing sociophysical metrics in many confusing or
      seemingly intentional directions
  - if they are part of a network, then your adversaries will seek to
    deconstruct their agenda or desired equilibria into many pieces.
    - they will delegate goals and objectives to entities in their
      networks with agency.
      - if this is happening, fucking run ... but it may not help.

  - when delegating across a network, agents can actually appear to
    work against one another towards the attainment of equilibria of
    specific sociophysical metrics. this is good cop & bad cop, but in
    a more advanced setting (not an interrogation at the downtown
    station)
    - one tries to isolate you, the other tries to draw you in
      specific directions. then they can see how you respond to
      make inferences about your behavior
    - this also forces your investment of energy to dissipate

- someone with an agenda is generally gravitating towards the
  attainment of a set of objectives/equilrium

![Folding Funnel Destructured Paths](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/)


- describe the attainment of those objectives of equilibria as being
  like the potential destructured paths in the folding funnel above
  - they've deconstructed a higher-level objectives into into a set of
    objectives, which confer advantage, control or mitigate some risk
    - what is an appropriate delination of terms? how do they relate
      to the concepts below: folding funnel, energy, entropy/entropy,
      potential conformation paths, local minima

- When proteins fold, ...
  - {maybe a picture really is worth 1000 words here, lol}
    - i want to mostly focus on:
      - (1) the singular final conformation, which is usually singular
        by necessity
      - (2) how enthalpy overpowers entropy here to arrive at a final
        stable conformation, even though this is not always so for all
        possible protein structures.
        - ... actually they would mostly have many local energy
          minima, but it's the relationship b/w form & function

  - what is the term for the energy value in the folding funnel?
  - the proteins structure is guided (randomly) along the curved
    surface of the folding funnel

  - in spite of entropy, enthalpy guides the folding towards local
    minima. in order for the protein to have consistent form and
    function, this typically must

  - the protein contains (evoluationarily-conserved structures) giving
    it an overall form ...


- That economic forces we cannot control introduce potential
  incentivization for depopulation is just another ravine in the
  metaphysical leylines contributing downward pressure rapidly
  accelerate towards several of the scenarios outlined in this
  article. Truly understanding much of Nassir Taleb's work on
  convexity and concavity of systems will help in deciphering the
  previous statement. What we're fighting against is not human. It's
  basically fate, which has presented us with social life exhibiting
  alarming concavities to avoid and essential convexities to use as
  tools. Concavities pull you away from regions of stabalization.
  Convexities provide "leylines" that focus entropy against all odds,
  yielding enthalpy that focuses reality into certain forms.

#### The Folding Funnel Demonstrates how Enthalpy Guides Protein Folding

![Entropy vs. Enthalpy]

- Understanding the webs of paths -- the webs of worldlines -- that
  move us towards this set of predestined or preordained points is key
  to understanding the best path forward. If you have a materialist
  conception of metaphysics, you are inherently challenged in
  understanding the phenomena unfolding in front of you for anything
  except what they **appear** to be. However, nothing is simply what
  it is. Everything you can hold, every idea you've had has a story of
  where it came from, stories for each fiber or piece of the object,
  stories for how that idea translated itself into action and
  transformed the world.

#### The Analogy of Leylines Illustrates the Shape that Guides the
Potential "Worldlines"

![Protein Folding and Metaphysical Leylines]

- Given the same set of information, the "classical" materialist can
  only see the potential for divergence. Revising their understandings
  of the world, adjusting for the clearly improbably, then they begin
  to see the possibility for the invisible hand, for intelligent
  design and for everything else that they cannot explain. This is
  because their worldview only permits them to see systems as chaotic
  and divergent, where there is no inherent similarity between
  configurations: no symmetry of all things. They are very
  intelligent, but they are wrong.

What is probabilistic programming? What are programs in chaos?
[This article](http://te.xel.io/posts/2017-09-14-awareness-precipitates-from-order-out-of-chaos.html)
argues that biophysical, sociophysical and metaphysical systems are
like programming frameworks where manipulation of feedback loops
enables a degree of antifragility, propagates facsimilarity and
promotes competition for accumulated reservoirs of energy.

There are means of modeling and studying both chaotic systems and the
design of programmatic systems within them. This applies to fields
such as the engineering of genetics and human logistic systems. The
tools for modeling these systems include
[Markovian state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)
within a kind of
[probability space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space)
that's distributed over some physical space. A critical concept in
biophysical programs is spatially distributed state: the variables of
these programs are the physically manifested byproducts of events. The
program "executes" by influencing the quantity, state, and
spatiotemporal location of these variables, which in turn influence
the frequencies of subsequent events in space.

#### Within Each of Us, Multitudes of Reflection And Refraction Descend and Ascend Infinitely

![Yin and Yang Across Space](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/yin-yang-across-space.jpg)

For sociophysical systems, these ideas of programming with
probabilistic and chaotic systems must include networks of entities
with agency whose inschematic Markovian state machines are tightly
coupled to facets of their environment, methods of communication and
means of interaction. For social physics, dynamics and mechanics of
multifarious strata homogeneously feed back into the system as a whole
where entities in each strata influence the macroscopic and
microscopic. [SOF entities](te.xel.io/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency.html)
are containers of state, will and agency on one scale, but
dualistically exist within a sociophysical system where macroscopic
containers of the same omnidirectionally influence one another.

Here, the particles exhibit perfect holonic perfraction, though the
total experiential understanding of this truth is incomputable for any
entity that ever be manifested on the physical plane. No false god, no
hyperintelligent entity, no network of superintelligent entities no
matter how human or artificial could ever conceive these
combinatorially perfracted structures. It is like a fractal of Yin and
Yang that pervades every sentient entity capable of agency. The only
entity that can conceive this exists as the metaphysical totality,
God, which does extend itself into our universe in unimaginable ways.

#### Yin and Yang is the 2-Form of a Fractal in Two Dimensions

![Infinities of Yin and Yang](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/yin-yang-fractal.jpg)

People throughout history have always been more capable of
understanding truths such as these, as well as the world around us, in
ways the modern person cannot conceive.

To understand this more fully, read the sections after
[無 de nada](/posts/2016-05-16-the-paradox-of-creativity.html#zen-de-nada)
in this discourse on the
[Paradox of Creativity](/posts/2016-05-16-the-paradox-of-creativity.html). There
are profound implications for how any cultural engineering should
envision teleology, so mankind can benefit from the replacement of
obselesced cultural practices for empowerment via semiotic
amplification that traces out self-empowering teleology. Before,
during and after the Singularity, almost all outdated cultural
practices which before teleologically inculcated knowledge and wisdom
will instead totally lose their relevance. They will be so
infrequently performed, that their ability to reinforce understandings
about life and society via teleological inference will instead simply
disintegrate.

In social physics, all SOF biophysical entities exist in the same
shared physical space. Their minds are like individual boltzmann
machines, but with a functional twist. Instead of being machine
learning constructs to recognize patterns in images, each brain is a
biophysical construct for consuming, recognizing and emulating
behaviors. Throughout life, we consume experiential and sensory
information. We reflect on those memories to produce, alter and store
aggregate memories. With increased quantity and expanded variety, our
brains layer down strata of conditioned mental residue. From our
current mental and neurological state, we correlate conditioned
phenomena -- such as behaviors, images and symbols -- to perceiving,
introspecting, replicating and altering the state of sociophysical
macrocosms, both spatiotemporally local and distant.

![LCD Phase Changes](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/lcd-phase-change-defects.png)

We have an innate desire to simulate and emulate, which drives our
learning process. Because this process is *similar* to a Boltzmann
machine, once an individual develops in a particular psychosocial
direction, they can become less likely to change. This may be a
property of Boltzmann machines -- categorically and typologically, as
simultaneously running image-recognition Boltzmann machines diverge,
each one become less capable of deviating from it's current category
and singleton metatype-composition. What does the picture above
symbolize for epistemological defects in shared knowledge systems
developed by cooperative entities? These entities are essentially
[Boltzmann machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine)
with myriad arbitrary notions of temperature and sociophysical energy.

- expand on this
  - transition to discussing how we attempt to model each other's
    knowledge, behavior and direction of focus.
  - by attempting to control the current, short-term or long-term
    direction of an entity's focus, their variety of input and
    experience can be both constrained and dialated
    - if you want to ruin someone's life and psychology, tightly
      constrain their variety of experience over the long-term

- by learning how people direct their focus,
  - their reactions can be anticipated. learning this takes time and
    investment of energy in a variety of experiences with the person.
    - this has both positive and negative uses. this is how you build
      a connection or relationship with a new friend.
      - if someone's interactions and social network are tightly
        constrained, they can't maintain a variety of interactions
        with people
      - when this is done to the extreme, it results in the utter and
        total deterioration of their support network.

In chaotic sociophysical systems, entities and information can be
conceived as incomprehensibly complex analogies of the same
macromolecules used in biophysical programs. That is, information can
be conceptualized in holonic particle form, entities exchange datums
and iotas of holonic information particles and these entities *are*
information. To understand what an information particle might look
like, envision a high-dimensional analogue of the yin and yang fractal
above. Finally, imagine molecules composed of such matter: this is
what your mind is made of.

- (the sociophysical transmission also gives rise to) (literal
  physical waves -- examples?). further still, the transmission of
  physical pheneomena also drive ripples of information through
  sociophysical networks.

![The Wave In A Stadium](/img/posts/the-wave.gif)

- if there is a spectral (understanding) of information-graphs, as
  ellusive as a visual conception might be, then surely a momentary
  spectrum can be lifted to a wave representation.
  - (reword this)
  - what would spectrum-to-time and time-to-spectrum transformations
    look/behave like?

- it isn't yet clear how, but the particle/wave duality also fits the
  holonic model of information
  - information in social physics should be modelable as waves,
    communicated among players in social games, idealized as
    particles)
  - social phenomena can be modeled with social physics, but almost
    everything is incomputable.
  - however, similar to how there are many kinds of interactions
    between particles and waves, interactions in social physics can be
    understood with infinite dimensional waves
    - however, the structure of information infinite and unknowable

- density/mass of information as particles
  - baggage you carry with you
  - example: first episode of Kino (where the other traveler asks Kino
    to help him carry his baggage)
  - limiting flexibility
  - ... explain/outline more here
  - does this relates to buddhism's usage of vehicular imagery?

- applying the idea of superposition of particle states to topologies
  of sociophysical networks.
  - in these networks, information can be represented by particles
    that behave in ways analogous to quantum particles.
  - for (each of us) to (intuitively function in social environments),
    we have to create our own subconscious intuition of sociophysical
    energy types and circuit topologies.
    - to (model/solve/anticipate the system), an algorithm without
      limits on computation must conceive of these networks as having
      infinitely many energy types, each with their own non-linear
      transduction mechanics, being pushed through social circuits,
      via physical and logical interactions
      - ....
      - superposition provides a mechanic that anticipates infinite
        possibilities that collapse into a convergent result in
        reality
        - (still just a metaphor)

  - this seems very similar to ideas from quantum computing circuit
    diagrams.

- preservation of information: in physics this is an incredibly
  important concept. in social physics, physical information is never
  destroyed, but sociophysical information exists as representations
  encoded into the material world
  - there are certainly cases where sociophysical information can be
    totally or partially destroyed.
    - this presents yet another type of fracture in the (equilibrium
      dynamics) of sociophysical (energy) equations & approximations

- of course, this analogy of information as particle/wave begs the
  question: what is sociophysical equivalent to critical mass & `E =
  m*c^2`

- [gibb's entropy?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(statistical_thermodynamics)#Gibbs_entropy_formula)

- for the common person to understand, they need to understand what a
  phase change in physics actually is and, most importantly, what a
  phase change is defined as outside of physical systems.
  - if you think of solid, liquid, gas, plasma, BEC ... what makes
    each one what it is?
    - they are composed of the same particles, mostly.
    - why is it that they "seem" so different, qualitatively?
    - how do you define what conditions lead some substance to begin
      to transform itself into a different phase?

- how do you model the interactions between a mixture of a single
  substance where different parts of the space you're observing are in
  different phases?
  - this is the most important part of understanding what a phase
    change is and carrying it over to non-physical systems: how does a
    physicist mathematically model different phases of a
    single-substance system and *why*?
  - this is what distinguishes systems with math that can model phases
    and those that can't.
    - phase changes introduce and enable dramatically different modes
      of interaction between the substance and both it's consitutuent
      parts and it's environment.
    - for example, solids propagate energy as more clearly defined
      waves moving across a more limited set of crystal configurations
      - liquids and gases also propagate waves of energy across the
        system, but there are more physical degrees of freedom for how
        a particle can kinetically react.
      - but, this qualitative change in how a particle reacts to its
        envrionment emerges not from signal particle or the state of
        its local environment, but from more macroscopic relationships
        that emerge from a *group* of particles.
        - that is, it's *difficult* to say whether a single atom of
          carbon is a particular phase at any temperature.
          - the carbon atom just acts like a carbon atom and nothing
            else.
        - as a aside: this is also why various configurations of
          matter at the nano scale can have such dramatically varied
          behaviors that do not appear on more macro scales and do not
          appear for singular atoms and molecules
        - some of these properties are chemical and electrical and,
          thus, are not traditionally considered "phases" by chemists
          or physicists.
          - physical phases are defined as being completely separate
            from the chemical properties of the atom or substance.
        - but the "phase" of a region of a substance determines how
          that section of matter interacts with matter of the same
          substance in other adjacent slices of space.
          - that is, even though it's very literally the same
            substance, the "rules" for how it physically interacts
            change.

- and so, there are phase changes in many kinds of systems. they are
  not just confined to physical systems. some chemical properties of
  matter can be dependent on the substance's phase.
  - some chemical properties that only emerge on the nanoscale could
    be modeled as "phases" although they are not related to the
    physical phases of solid, liquid or gas.
    - and so, as you zoom out to larger collections of the same
      substance, it loses those properties from the nanoscale
      configuration of matter, unless that fragile nanostructure is
      held consistent across the entire material.

- nature of duality vs agency, along geographic/philosophic dimensions
- an agent's degree of influence and perceived influence over
  environment, especially as it relates to some permanent state
  changes.
  - in particle systems which are high-dimensional and where the
    particles have agency and intentionality, phase changes among
    particles have a far greater capacity for effecting other
    particles in the system.
  - how did this section correlate to phase changes?

Social isolation correlates strongly with vulnerability, poverty,
mental illness and the inability to tap into local economic
opportunities.

- in space, no one can hear you scream.
- isolated individuals are more likely to quit or be fired at jobs
  - if someone systematically attacks your social connections or
    alters the frame of people in your 1&deg; and 2&deg; social
    boundaries, it severely constricts your options and level of
    awareness your friends and family have of your life.
    - when you are extremely isolated and something wonderful or
      traumatic happens in your life, no one will know.
      - you completely lose the network effect in life.
    - social networks and interactions should be
- blurb about abusive relationships

This particular postulate should be considered axiomatic.

- social isolation/connectedness (in/dependence and vulnerability)
- this isn't really something considering almost axiomatic, which
  definitely describes the other two...
- third: social isolation is quantifiable and almost always correlates
  with power. more isolated, less empowered.
  - isolated individuals are more susceptable to manipulation


The impact on connectedness and digital communications were quantified
in this 2013 paper from Cisco and MIT. Though "there did not seem to
be individuals on the extreme periphery of the network", those
employees interested in the study seemed to outperform on
*quantifyable* metrics.[^increasing-knowledge-worker-efficiency]

#### Power *FROM* The People

This
[Revolution of Empowerment](https://github.com/dcunited001/dcunited001.github.io/blob/sources/_drafts/our-revolution-of-empowerment-engineering-diffusion-of-influence.md)
is a manifesto on using social physics informed by ethics, utility,
purpose and values. It's been nearly finished for about eight months
now. It covers use social physics driven by data-science to *EMPOWER*
people, instead of crippling them, terrifying them and, worst of all,
fueling surveillance-informed psychological torture. Utopian
applications of social engineering *always* sound so promising on
paper, but what we have in America is technology driven by malice,
fear and paranoia: hardly what social physics *could do* for the
average person. For most of those in poverty, the entire course and
cause of their plight, could they simply be empowered with what we are
all born with: the potential to leverage sociophysical energy to
transform our surroundings. (move: As someone with libertarian-leaning
ideas on civil rights, privacy and data-ownership, I hesitate to
enable the government in this regard because even the best intentions
go horribly awry.)


- {from article on math} furthermore, there are people who's mental
  state is the result of their life experience, either in the past or
  because of current conditions. There are many types of individuals
  who suffer with improper diagnosis because of isolation, abusive
  relationships, and many other reasons. Social data science can
  easily distinguish those individuals.
  - Part of the [Biocomplexity Institute](https://www.bi.vt.edu/) at
    Virginia Tech, the
    [Social and Decision Analytics Laboratory](https://www.bi.vt.edu/research/Social-and-Decision-Analytics-Laboratory)
    is...
    - While any widespread social data science without consent results
      in unsettling privacy issues, the only institutions with access
      to data needed for social data science are instead using it for
      control. In some cases, it is specifically used to exacerbate
      mental health problems. This results in major economic strain,
      regardless of whether the taxpayer, businesses or the family
      covers mental health costs.

Isolation causes or exacerbates mental illness. When isolation is
protracted, it severly restricts their medium and long-term mental
states via constriction of variety of experience and inbound social
signal. It shrouds people in a
[fog of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war). If it really
does severly impact quality of life, couldn't we reduce unnecessary
budget deficits through means such as removing large drains on
publicly or privately financed healthcare. (It can definitely make a
difference. However, iatrogenic treatment has caused horrible
consequences in my own life.)

- social isolation can be measured, given some "normal" facebook
  user's 2-degree graph of friends for some definition of normal
  (casual but regular) social media usage
  - filter the friends by strength of connection to indentify edges
    sending and receiving inbound and outbound messages/interactions
    - measure the degree of reciprication and the variety of people
      forming the strongest recent connections
    - filter out all connections which do not fit some minimum of
      interaction threshold
    - this sparsifies the graph, filtering a dense graph and leaving
      only the most relevant connections
  - from here, the person's isolation can be measured using spectral
    graph theory
    - this independence can be measured in graph theory with
      kelman's transformation
    - see spectral graph theory
      [here](http://www.cs.elte.hu/~csiki/application_Kelmans.pdf),
      [here](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~mtait/k-independent.pdf)
      - and [here](https://www.cs.elte.hu/math/phd_th/csiki.v2.pdf)
      - the details of this math is over my head btw

- this, of course, assumes the person is a "normal" facebook user,
  where the relevant 1-degree and 2-degree connections in the friend
  graph are all also "normal" users
  - this high-level algorithm could also work with clustered types of
    facebook users
    - yet, the degree in variation in how people use applications to
      communicate and their distribution of time/usage across multiple
      applications makes clustering extremely difficult.
    - at least, if a clustering algorithm is to enable the selection
      of users which fit some basis with quantifyable variation and
      some metric of confidence

- during and after segregation, social isolation created massive, but
  hard-to-see setbacks for the african american community. this
  strongly limited social mobility because african americans forged a
  disproportionately small amount of strong connections with
  influential people with social/financial capital.
  - this is especially hard to see if you don't experience it.
  - the exact consequences of this are difficult to see or prove, but
    it means opportunities for advancement and economic well being
    were consistently out of reach, even after segregation officially
    ended.
  - even though the law was fixed, minority communities had a greater
    average networking distance to the gatekeepers of economic
    opportunities (not all white people, but rich white people),
    though it's difficult to measure
  - this takes time to heal, though there is plenty of room for
    improvement, i think it has significantly improved over the
    previous three generations.

- in a purely digital world, manipulation of social media algorithms
  to exclude "undesirable" individuals could create disconnection
  among groups of people, defined logically instead of by ethnicity
  (let us NEVER do that).
  - i don't mean this to be compared to segregation
  - in a convergent social network that is increasingly less engaged
    in "real" interactions and more engaged in "virtual" interactions,
    where some interactions can be voluntarily or involuntarily
    censored via SEO/Social Media manipulation, this means that entire
    groups of people can become silenced or disenfranchised without
    even knowing it.

Semiolinguistic connectedness leads to a paradox where obvolution of
language, signs and images dramatically reduces the set of
possibilities. Information or connections assumed to be completely
invisible will be revealed for what it is regardless of how hard
people worked to suppress some of it, even if some of it was never
transmitted or spoken in plain langauge. This is especially true once
online identity validation is nearly universal or can be retroactively
resolved. People don't generate content or expend energy that isn't
relevant or meaningful.

In thermodynamic, biophysical and genetic systems, patterns of change
and entropy in configurational and conformational distributions
provide a metric measuring complex similarity metatypes of programs in
chaos. Using this, one can dilineate genetic programs and other
complex non-deterministic systems. Moreover, a formulation of this
metric *could provide a kind of digital signature*. It's design would
diverge from traditional digital signature methods and would likely
only serve to identify the nature and type of a program.

#### Does This Go Gamestate Look Random? Is Any Gamestate Random?

![Go Game Board](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/go-game-board.jpg)

For games like Go or Chess, can natural gamestates be sampled from a
uniform distribution of gamestates? Why would this deviate
significantly from the set of gamestates in novice or pro games? So a
probability distribution over the set of all gamestates should be
mostly sparse. Why is this? Because the moves that players choose are
tightly coupled the rules of the game. Metrics of similarity for
gamestates provided the basis for dilineation of functionally similar
gamestates that provided the basis for information compression in the
recent Go algorithm, enabling the game to be solved much sooner than
anticipated.

<!-- i "allegedly" talked to tatiana about the pythagorean triples
     problem. the major advancement enabling both Go and the
     [Boolean Pythagorean Triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem)
     problem was the usage of information compression to condense the
     problem spaces.

     e.g. for Pyth triples:
       - 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2
       - 2*(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2)

     .... hmmmm, that's actually not true, so it's another
     inconsistency. am i remembering my triggered memory correctly?
     paul vasquez made it clear i was not to write about meeting
     her... but never why.

     but an article about the solution triggered dejavu and the
     solution does use information compression. other triggered
     memories involving math problems include menger sponge volume
     (0), matroids (the marriage problem), birdman 3D stereoscopic
     video composition (filming at the time, w/ change order in 2013),
     nucleotide edit distance, gravitational wave detection (from dual
     black hole event, though that's obvious) and others. it was like
     an IQ test after the menger sponge question.

     strange that i was never aware of most of this stuff. i would see
     an image and recall things i had never thought about before. only
     a few of the memories would provide me with insights about
     knowledge i could be certain was *correct* and did not exist
     within me. other times, there were many inconsistencies and facts
     would be incorrect, where i made dumbass mistakes, which i was
     stupidly overconfident about and only later discovered i was
     wrong. the quality, quantity and types of sensory content of
     these memories varies wildly: some contain other people and many
     contain no people, except me and her. we could not have possibly
     talked for ~36 hours.

     conveniently, if i were to ever say anything, people could
     instantly accuse me of being crazy. doubtless that *20% or more
     may have been real*, but the rest could not be true. simply keep
     me socially/financially pinned down for X months/years and the
     problem would probably take care of itself. strange how there
     were so many legally material aspects of these memories, like my
     subconscious contained some jungian dream archetype that
     practiced national security law on the side. they were not
     dreams. whatever happened to me, it would take care of 99.999% of
     the cases.

When people seat themselves at tables for a meal, they choose a seat
one at a time. When approaching the table, people naturally sort
themselves into an ordering that reveals some information about
whether choosing a seat is important to them. The first people to get
there fill the space naturally: if there are spatial constraints to
choosing less accessible seats, then people who deviate from common
courtesy reveal information. Sit closer to the center of the table and
you're more connected. Taking a less connected seat can reduce the
supply of adjecent seats with a physically reduced factor of
sociophysical friction: increased phsyical distance. Therefore,
because of the element of choice, the set of potential seating
arrangements is similarly not random.

> needed to resort to thermodynamics to understand.

Everything reveals information, but parsing incommplete and
inschematic information is usually prohibitively complex. look for
tightly coupled position, orientaion and change in field of view: when
the specific configuration starkly departs from natural non-coupled
sociophysical configuration, it shows. If you artificially randomize
everything you do and change your position, field of view and
orientation without justification, then people tightly coupled to your
behavior must do the same. This tight coupling reveals everything, but
false positives abound.

- in the above, position, field of view and orientation describe
  conformational changes.
  - configurational entropy is moreso about

As a sociophysical system progresses, you can keep track of the amount
of time specific "molecular" configurations of participants spent
connected. This forms a kind of combinatorially-derived entropy -- but
not thermodynamic entropy. It's closer to Shannon's informational
entropy, which measures entropy in a more symbolic space. The holonic
information molecules form local configurations where each node in a
group can have a different holonic composition of metatypes. Atoms are
easy to dilineate into a periodic table of elements and isotopes, but
holons have infinite variation, so it is only possible to reason about
similarity of metatype composition.

![Cyclohexane Conformations](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/cyclohexane-conformations.png)

#### Cyclohexane Rapidly Transitions Between Its Conformations

The frequency of cyclohexane conformations in a solution depends upon
the variance between the energy required to stabalize that
conformation and energy required to transition to each other state.
These transitions can be modeled by a discrete Markov chain. When you
see an abundance of one conformation with extremely low probability it
means the actual entropy of that solution is highly anomolous.

![Random Walk Along the Conformational Free Energy Landscape](/img/posts/2017-10-21-speed-of-thought-twenty-postulates-of-social-physics/free-energy-conformations.jpg)

#### A Random Walk Along the Conformational Free Energy Landscape

A molecule's state transitions follow a random walk on the curved
surface of the energy gradient the current state's Brownian motion
results from adjacent forces. All molecules are unique vibrations and
have specific conformational entry points when they are formed. As the
molecule persists, average motion should encourage it to gravitate
towards a vibration more typical for that type of molecule. This is
mostly informed by classical mechanics, so may not be 100% correct.

Groups of people in conversations, follow similar paths around
conformational transitions representing their current state

- (define a group's conformation as ... )

Within a sociophysical game, people modeled as molecules may alter
their local spatial arrangment, which more closely parallels
conformational entropy. From variance and change in conformation in a
group of people, you can infer information about the types of
interactions that will emerge from that group's conversation in the
coffee shop or at a bar. If the variance devates too strongly or the
rate of change increases too quickly, this indicates that something
new might happen. (Observing this when that conformation-state or
change in state has an interestingly low probability, leading to lower
entropy and perhaps indicating a skewed distribution.) If it is
important, you should proactively elicit reactions for more
information.



#### Distributions on Spaces

- visualize feng shui by coloring each point with the set of angles
  that each social node is likely to orient itself... somehow
  - so you're looking to summarize the set of angles at which social
    nodes normally appear for each point at the space
  - no one in a space stares at the wall, unless there's art hanging
    up. this is completely different in an art gallery, where most
    people orients themselves in discussions around art. here, the
    phenomenon is reversed to some degree.
    - however, in most spaces, people are more interested in
      interacting with each other. yet, objects in the environment
      will foment interaction.
      - pool tables, TV's, food trucks, etc: each one of these is an
        example of an inanimate object that exerts a kind of gravity
        on the social particles in the space, resulting in an
        influence on the position and orientation distribution.

- distributions on spaces are (always?) composed of superpositions of
  both integrated and differentiated distributions on the space
  - so, people (and particles) move because we live in a world with
    time. if you look at the frequency of social particle positions in
    a space, then a distribution emerges that corresponds to the
    probability of finding a social particle in a given area of that
    space. we'll call that the position distribution.
  - where does this distribution emerge from? in addition to other
    components, it emerges from the superposition of particle paths in
    a space. so, for an area in a space to register in the original
    position distribution, there have to be particle paths from
    neighboring areas that intersect with the area of concern.
    - furthermore, the contribution of particle paths from neighboring
      areas will be balanced by the speed of particles moving through
      that area.
    - that the particle position distribution emerges from
      superpositions of other distributions is incredibly important in
      understanding why it is the way it is and how it might change.
      - however, there usually isn't enough data to fully understand
        the particle position distribution and especially its
        components.
      - further, in a truly social space, the particle's experiences,
        decisions and actions have a subjective quality to them

- one particularly important quality of probability distributions is
  that they must integrate to the value one. so, increases in one area
  of the space must result in decreases to other.



- the position distribution in a space identifies areas of the space
  where power and influence can be amplified, simply by occupying or
  using that region of the space.
  - areas of a space can have power if they have a high frequency of
    particles or a low frequency.
    - other aspects of that area of the space confer advantages and
      disadvantages. in some areas, people move more slowly. some
      areas invoke common types/metatypes of psychological state in
      people.
    - to leverage the space, you must decide on what you want from
      your interactions with people. some people can intuitively see
      this, but almost no one does so methodically or pragmatically.

- it is critical to understand what disaggregated components are
  superimposed to obtain higher-order aspects of the distributions of
  the space.
  - these lower-order components reveal tight-coupling between the
    people and the space. the functional specifics of this coupling
    are tools that can be used to affect the behavior of people, on
    scales both small and large.

- for the same reason that the center of a chessboard is usually the
  most valuable/contested region, the center of a medium-sized
  square/round room exhibits the highest probabilities in its position
  distribution.
  - yet, once you define the doors, objects and facets in the room, it
    profoundly alters the emergent position distribution. all paths
    *through* the room must be coupled to a doorway. therefore, the
    doors will root the distribution of paths through the room, which
    sums to one of the component distributions that determine the
    superposed position distribution.
    - a good exception to this is a skating rink. why? because there
      is usually one public entrance/exit to a building which is
      otherwise open space. but the activity of the space encourages
      specific paths of motion that sum to circular motion. therefore,
      it's not the center of the open space with the highest
      probability of social particles, it's the ring around the center
      of the space. therefore, the position distribution is determined
      by the distribution of paths of particles through the space,
      which itself is tightly coupled to the activity that the space
      offers.
  - moving back to how the doors, objects and facets of a space define
    its position distribution: the empty space is the most normal
    space. anything deviating from the position distribution thus
    exhibits higher entropy of probability distributions. the empty
    space is thus the space with minimal entropy for measures of
    entropy between spaces.

- you do not need computers to measure these distributions. you only
  need a surface upon which information is embedded, which results in
  a aggregate measure of foot traffic. the surface of an ice skating
  rink -- erased at the beginning of each season -- reveals this
  distribution for the session at the end of each session.
  - mountain biking paths reveal information about the volume of
    traffic, since the last moderate weather event.
    - that these aggregate measure of traffic in outdoor environments
      is erased by moderate weather events is crucial to scouting and
      tracking people, especially large numbers of people. with the
      advent of satellite imagery, it is less important to military
      tactics and strategy today. Still, weather and uncontrollable
      environmental effects occupy an entire element in Sun Tzu's Art
      of War -- the metaphors thereof are still incredibly relevant,
      but their lessons are semioteleologically dampened by the
      changing nature of human experience.
  - even though these short-term distributions are erased -- either by
    moderate weather events or by the zamboni -- each specific
    distribution has its own idiosyncratic deviations from the average
    of all such distributions, as well as its intrinsic evolution.
    therefore, there is another kind of *variation* in these spatial
    distributions, which elicits much more information about the
    specific components of the superposition which results in both
    this session's position distribution and the evolving long-term
    position distribution.
    - this variation itself results in yet another measure of
      distributional entropy between each session's distribution, the
      average distribution for all sessions and the evolution of the
      average distribution.
    - this proves the point that more information does not always make
      something more complicated. in fact, instead of expanding the
      space of possiblities, the varation and entropy defined above,
      along with all the other phenomena profoundly contracts the
      space of possibilities, making it possible to know what no one
      could ever anticipate you would know.
      - this is my favorite aspect of social physics: the people that
        manipulate me, torment me and haunt my life with their toxic
        sociophysical miasma can never anticipate what i know and how
        i know it.

- Listening to a cannon blast in a stadium on every touchdown
  - when repetitive stimuli condition us to recognize and react to
    phenomena, we react to this phenomena by attaching our own
    information to the holonic particle form of information attached
    to physical stimuli.
    - when the cannon fires, at what point do people respond? when
      they hear it, since it travels at the speed of sound.
      - this also manifests physical wavelike phenomena: in a large
        stadium, the information radially expands outwards. there is a
        brief (opening) where some people may subconsciously react the
        visual cues before they hear the conditioned stimulus.
  - even fans on campus not present at the game can know when a
    touchdown is scored or when the game ends.

- if information can be conceived as packets or particles, then when
  does the information take on particular forms
  - combining datums modeled by holons with lambda calculus
    - { quantum entanglement seems to be a manisfestation of a kind of
      probabilistic lambda calculus }
  - the physical manisfestation of the information is not meaningful
    until it develops a corresponding physical manisfestation in an
    information-processing agent.
    - therefore: metaphysical entanglement
    - this kind of entanglement can "reach back through time" in a
      way, without communication when the necessary details are
      predetermined by protocol or patterns of conditioned
      response.
      - information representations can effect each other through time
        and space, without direct physical connections.
      - this is because some information processing entities are
        autonomous.

- the scoreboard at a stadium
  - when do the fans at a football game internalize information? only
    when exposed to physical phenomena that carries with it a
    potential stimulis. if checking the score, (this info could be
    carried) via light from the digital scoreboard or by social
    inference.
    - if the stimulus is a holonic particle, then where does it exist?
    - can a message be conveyed with a single photon? no.
    - but we can't react to something until the entire holonic
      particle is ingested
      - the information representations, including their symbolic
        association, can be conceived to be carried with the physical
        phenomena
      - these could only every provoke response if their form carried
        potential symbolic meaning along their
        [world line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line).

  - if this holonic entanglement (were not correct), Carl Sagan could
    not assume the Voyager could be interpreted *prima facie*.
    - (...the aliens would only be able to decipher information
      according to their own metaphysical conceptions of information.)
    - why is this? the information is conveyed in the form of the
      physical presentation.
      - {is this actually a good sidetrek that proves my point?}
      - {this may actually be a counter-example? ... or not}
        - the aliens who receive the message could not react in a way
          to signal to the senders
          - { unless the Ansible exists ... but that's beside the
            point. }
        - the senders could assume, based upon primative mphys. forms,
          that the aliens would understand & react in a specific way
          (or might)
    - there could also be no
      [characteristica universalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristica_universalis)
      -- no universal language based on mathematic logical
      primitives. These somehow map to enumerated semiotic primitives
      forms, which is the basis for a language that needs no
      pre-established protocol. It increases the speed of one-way
      communication by a factor of two among aliens who might never
      live long enough to repeat a message.
      - the assumption that a characteristica universalis could exist
        and be meaningful is only possible if these semiotic forms can
        be enumerated purely from a kernal of logic, a priori -- that
        can be known with certainty that the message will be
        understood. otherwise it's impractical and because of its
        utility, this is how aliens will decide to accelerate
        communication.
