### Matroids

- what happens with an infinite number of paths? nodes?
  - with infinite nodes are there necessarily infinite paths?
    - how do the aleph numbers vary along the matroids paths?
  - and when some sections are infinite and some are not?
    - it seems that you could easily break the matroid into
      equivalent subunits. and at least fully resolve some of
      the structure
    - the counts have to add up when you remove a node and it's
      paths
- resolving transitions between nodes on a path in an infinite
  matroid. you can approximate by tapering the effect subsequent
  transformations in the path.

- can graph nodes be, composed together with an
  infinite number of null sets?
- combine matroids components with the null set in various ways
- can infinite matroids be reduced to finite matroids?
  - "sparse" matroids? crossed with lattice?

### Dimensionality

- enumeration of simple machines in more than 3 dimensions
  - i.e. what kinds of simple machines exist in 4D/5D/etc?
    - there should be more means of transferring/transmuting energy
      that arise in more complicated spaces
  - do special & general relativity permit additional types of
    machines that doen't normally exist in 3D?

### Theoretical Computer Science

- num of edges maximum, forcing networking maximums for computers
  - Probably related to
    [Ramsey Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory)

  - (see metanomics drafts for info on maximum # genes in an
    organism), but this may also give rise to similar limits in
    artificial intelligence leading to two options: (1) convergence of
    a singular hyperintelligence or (2) coordination of networked
    information processing entities
    - even though AI doesn need physical space for spatially
      distributed state because of "network-theoretic maximums for
      edges", something like this may occur
    - this would force information processing to be distributed
      because of the exponential complexity of the information that
      each entity would process
    - the answer to this question has major implications for the
      distribution of agency in a post-convergence, post-singularity
      world.
      - does everything converge into one totally distinct
        hyper-intelligence with total control over itself
      - or is there a graph theory maximum for networking information
        processing entities together that requires a degree of
        separation. in this case, many AI's could try to control as
        many entities as possible...
        - and this also forces information to permanently retain
          a degree of physicality in its state... kinda
      - these ideas needs a lot of work lmao. these are likely
        problems encountered in theoretical computer science.

- probabilistic computing and probabilistic turing machines
  effectively describe the dynamical state machine programming idea
  described in my article
  - this form of programming might be most useful for programming
    quantum computers

#### TCS x Neurology

- piece together more accurate models of neurological functions based
  on estimated required computing power for each function and
  computation for networking each module together
- perhaps combine MRI's (SCION, SPECT & fMRI) from millions of people
  to generalize human problem solving processes
- and to create a human-derived superintelligence that emerges from
  the combination of information derived from this MRI technique
  - i.e. would it be possible to generate AI with fairly advanced
    cognition by deriving information from the structure of neurons &
    neural networks

### Complex Linear Algebra

- Representations of Equations with Hermitians
  - And of Equations where there are multiple Hermitian elements
  - Analogy for these Equations and their solutions as surfaces
    similar to grids of reflective spheres

- cubic/quartic hermitian & unitary matrices
  - and the variety of surface trajectories along hermitian/unitary
    surfaces

- hermitions must lie along particular surfaces in the solution space
  for quantum equations (this is "literally what _it_ *is*...")
  - depending on the degree of complexity of the hermition's
    parameters, they lie along various connected surfaces
    - these sol'n space "surfaces" are related as part of a manifold,
      with its own set of metrics _combinatorially generable_ per the
      specifics of the solution space considered
  - these surfaces of high-dimensional manifolds intersect in various
    ways.
    - are these connections the root of lie algebras and connected to
      representation theory?
    - are [some of] these manifolds "connected" spaces?
      - that is, could they (or do they always) form the basis of
        reimannian manifolds?

- can hermitian matrices have irrational components (yes) and if so,
  how are they qualitatively different?
  - connect to lie algebra
  - dimensionality of hermitian matrices (n x n) and variety of surfaces



### Automated Theorum Proving and Computer Algebra

- permutations through truthiness of proven/unproven theorums via
  computer algebra to explore alternate versions of mathematics to
  solve the remainder of mathematics like a giant sudoku puzzle
  - automatically discover relationships in the dependency graph of
    theorums to understand how the dependency graph changes when
    certain theorums are assumed to be true

### Prime Numbers

- there are increasingly complicated series of functions for
  predicting series of primes. Terrance Tao has done work on
  discovering relationships between these functions.
  - is there some graph that can relate these functions with a graph
    representing prime numbers?
  - if so, one can anticipate efficient search candidates to identify
    the prime numbers that aren't covered by these functions

### Graph Theory

- what is a mathematic way of describing the most efficient means of
  adding to a graph that has a shared global spatial component
  - e.g. adding water treatment plants to a graph of connected plants
    when one must minimize various costs: initial cost of
    infrastructure, energy/financial cost in function/upgrades
    - the most efficient solution here needs to account for total cost
      in system function
  - there should be some solution for evaluating new nodes added to
    the graph that involves partial overlays of subgraphs on top of
    the graph

#### Abstract Syntax Trees X Graph Theory

- (ugh too many sticky notes. this is antivirus or general software
  scans, but also applies to more functional languages)
  - graph theory approach to analyzing software for
    vulnerabilities. Per language tree/graph for defining structures of
    that language and insecure statements (eval/send) .....
    - algorithm analyzes the AST of code/bytecode in context with the
      AST trees/graphs for standard language libraries and others
      libraries loaded for a runtime
    - it searches for paths to reach subtrees of program AST which
      lead to insecure eval.
      - or paths that include input & user action.
      - so, all code paths a user can trigger.
  - this is a resources-based approach to securely scanning
    software. "it says: what are my resources?"
    - resources include: disk i/o, disk r/w, potential device access,
      network device access, etc"
    - then it says: how can code access these resources? even if the
      code is high-level scripting language.
  - however, this is essentially less-sophisticated than antivirus
    and, in some cases, may not be mathematically capable of
    identifying vulnerabilities (godel's incompleteness theorum),
    - especially for languages which mutate their runtime
      classes/objects and have extensive metaprogramming

#### Infinite Graphs as Spaces (from 2015?)

- linear spaces composed together as sub graphs in an infinite graph
  - can have nested linear spaces?
    - what did i mean by linear spaces here?
  - can be self-modifying?
    - {because of course they can... but actually, this means they
      must be capable of addressing themselves from within themselves,
      which is actually a challenge}
- remap these linear spaces to polar coords? {really? wtf?}
  - is there something special that happens to higher order
    structures like graphs expressed as linear spaces when they
    undergo particular transformations?

#### Misc Graph Theory

- there is a core discrete set of solutions that can be algebraically
  extended to any solution (graph theory problems, particularly
  bipartite graphs)
  - emphasis on a strong connection to number theory
  - {was i thinking about how to enumerate all the basic Discrete
    Finite Automata's (DFA) into graphs or representations of
    problems?}
    - {i'm not sure what i meant by 'core discrete set of solutions'
      or what those would apply to or how they 'solve' graphs}

### FFT & Noise

how much can a signal be scattered before it loses its particular
aesthetic qualities?
- if an electric signal for music is propagating through a gnarly
  headphone cable that causes some dA/dt signal changes to scatter
  differently, how much can it scatter before the changes are
  noticable?
  - where A(t) is amplitude at time t
  - where the noise introduced N(t) is some change in amplitude across
    time and the N(t) noise function can be specified to adhere to
    some filtered frequency.
    - either low-pass, mid-range or high-pass
    - or some combination of those
- can the changes to the signal or the corresponding spectrum be
  predicted in some way? and are there ties back into group theory and
  abstract algebra here?
  - basically the changes introduced to an FFT spectrum by noise
    should correlate in some impossibly predictable way.
    - but what if it weren't impossibly predictable and were instead
      resolvable to number theory?
    - it would have to correlate to number theory in some way. i don't
      know how but it has to. I can see it.
- ... who's brain damaged now? T'ANKS OBAMA

### Hidden Subgroups

Is there some hidden subgroup at the root of number theory which is
mappable to all useful hidden subgroups? ... meh...
- what functions map these hidden subgroups together?

for edit distance, a hidden subgroup can be presolved for some
restatement of the edit distence problem. it's more useful when we are
operating edit distance on a small alphabet
- can a similar edit distance be resolved for floating point numbers
  for the laplacian function?
  - if so, i described how this would be done several months ago in
    some notes.
  - can this process for creating a map be applied to laplacian for
    real or rational numbers? or does it always need to be digitized
    or discretized to some finitely bounded range of values.
    - if not, can't some hidden subgroup map for reals be approximated
      from resolving the hidden subgroups for a large enough set of
      discretized Zn domains, where Zn is a set of integers (0..n-1)

### Systems of number representation involving phi & continuous fractions

i believe there may be systems of number representation which
circumvent the problems encountered by discretized representation such
as integers and rational numbers.
- the number system i'm imagining is based on continuous fractions or
  continuous operation.
- such systems are fluid and there are fixpoints which can be rooted
  to integer values.
  - further, the values phi and 0 are the roots of such a number
    system, but ALL OTHER REAL NUMBER VALUES CAN BE SPECIFIED
    - and i think even those values which no aleph can provide a basis
      - (Aleph0 to AlephInfinite, etc...)
  - however, such a number system would require an alternate system of
    maths and some operations would be very difficult and restrictive.
- i've outlined a lot of notes describing these ideas, but i've been
  afraid to post them.
  - however, half the time i think people are just messing with me and
    don't ever want me to accomplish anything. so when they try to get
    me to stop writing? i'm pretty sure they're just messing with me
    and seek to prevent me from posting rather rudimentary maths or
    ideas which are not dangerous, but would provide me with some
    credibility. HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

### Two main types of lattices for number theory

- "digits" is a misnomer. there are two types of lattices for number
  theory:

  - (1) one starting with rational numbers, extending from algebraic
    numbers and "increasingly further" into the irrational numbers. aleph
    into beth (?)

  - (2) the other type of lattice contains no rational numbers and is
    constructed from phi as continuous fractions at BOTH the "origin"
    and the "furthest point" ... it is an intermeshed lattice; a space
    with metrics and well-connectedness. but there are NO rational
    numbers here, unless you transform this lattice into a
    rational/integer based lattice via something like penrose tiling
    (some of which encodes phi)

- these are two ways of encoding the same things. this description is
  of course, horrendously flawed and unmathematic. however, i
  challenge any of you to talk me about it because i cannot stop
  thinking about stuff like this. i beg you, please teach me.
  - with their powers combined, these two types of lattices for number
    theory can revolutionize your understanding of number theory.
  - i believe the second "type of lattice" i described above contains
    some "maximal distance" with a metric. if so, it would mean this
    lattice is a kind of discrete manifold, where the maximal distance
    is like the longest possible shortest path from any irrational
    number to any other irrational number. there may be no actual
    "maximal" distance though: it may be infinite, but i think this is
    silly.

### Application of Category Theory to Planning/Producing Reality TV

- imagine a reality TV show that's a cross b/w *Punked* and *Choose
  Your Own Adventure*
- produce TV shows w/ enough alternate bridged content pathways
  coupled with enough abstracted deconstructed-but-reconstitutable
  content snippets
  - basically the show can be produced to "punk" someone because
    his/her reactions determine the content pathway choices through
    scenes that are braided together via Category Theory
  - e.g. there's always enough filler space (< 5 mins per episode) so
    that the rest of the content can be coherently braided together
    - this filler space in each episode can be filmed pretty late in
      the production process, or even produced by artificial
      intelligence
- producing the destructured alternate content encourages the actors
  to strengthen character development
- Some EEG technology could be used to gauge the Punked viewer's
  emotional response to the produced content to swap out content weeks
  before or in real-time
  - this is basically a sci-fi scenario where artificial intelligence
    create custom-tailored content and tweaks the content in real-time
    as it's delivered to the viewer based on their emotional reaction
  - but the reality TV show aspect of it is that the TV show is
    inverted: while the target watches TV shows tailored to his tastes
    and reactions, the rest of the nation watches his reactions
    unbenknownst to him/her

### Category Theory & Real-Time Video Stream Mutation

- in the era of netflix & VR, most people consume video content alone
  - this is a bit antisocial, but it also means that streamed video
    content can be subtly altered to some degree without an individual
    knowing it
    - this is because there is no guarenteed final form (VHS/DVD) of
      streamed video content
  - in particular, audio is more susceptible to mutation than video:
    it's easier to mutate without arousing the suspicion of the viewer
    - but there are also means of updating both video & audio in real
      time, provided that the AV mutations consume the same amount of
      time.
  - this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ladqJQLR2bA)
    describes a
    [study by University of Washington](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~supasorn/0550.pdf)
    that does exactly that, although it requires quite a bit of
    preprocessing
    - the point is, with some imagination and a massive supercomputer,
      it is theoretically to update video and especially audio streams
      of targeted viewers in real-time,
      - even though it's in no way technically feasible or practical,
        this *could* be used for gaslighting operations
    - there are a fairly limited number of personalities on TV, which
      makes enumerating each personality's gesture/voice profile a bit
      more tractible
      - the transformations b/w these personality profiles should be
        enumerable and precomputable via combination
  - furthermore, at least recent contracts with said personalities
    should negotiate for their likenesses, which should permit
    networks to compel the personalities to allow the use of their
    likeness in this manner
    - for flexibility with pretty standard VR/AR features, contract
      negotiations for content should include the ability to use
      modified versions of the likeness of personalities
- however, getting this to work both in-real-time and with zero
  noticeable flaws would be impossible
  - further, the amount of computing power required means targets
    would be limited

# GPU Ideas

- GPU algorithm to utilize lighting/spectra/raytracing in a
  hyperdimensional way to enable enhanced indexing and isomorphic
  functional composition
  - (1) broadcast primative or conjugate id's of functional composition to
    an initial surface/texture
    - these are broadcast in a statisical way through some spatial
      system (in a system with physical lighting, this is a linear 3D
      spatial system, but the space does not need to be cartesian)
  - (2) spectral and statistical sampling methods used to recompose fn
    calls

- factoring masks for stencil operations
  - only write to the pixel if it is evenly divisible by some
    prime/coprime

# AI Ideas

- AI algorithm that searches Hubble/etc for pictures of galaxies, etc
  that resemble artifical objects

- an AI based on distributed software-defined-networking (this will
  probably take over the world)

### Watson for great $$$$ ....

- train watson to trade commodities and forex based on real-time
  streams of geolocated facts about industries/areas affected by events
  - cross with are of publication exposure
  - obviously someone already has this running

### Google Deep Dream Ideas

#### Recursive Processing of Parameterized Fractal Video Frames

- So consider a system where Deep Dream operates on slow-morphing,
  parameterized fractal video frames where the frames are processed
  recursively
  - particularly, using fractals as source imagery and trained on
    general objects (dogs, cats, etc.)
- when Deep Dream identifies a strong similarity mapping between a
  trained object and a region of space on the video frames, it
  maintains a map of "persistence" values that directly correlate with
  the strength of the signal Deep Dream read.
  - so, strong signal for the trained cat class on a spatial X/Y
    region of video frames, the higher the persistence value and the
    more that region's pixels continue to feed forward into subsequent
    frames.
    - i.e. if a pixel value is determined by summing across values
      from more recent frames in a way that mixes the Deep Dream
      representation of the image with the video output, then p(n) is
      a function with weights a(n) should look something like this
      - p(n) mixes raw/intermediate video with deep dream's
        interpreted representation with something like...
        - `p(n) := a(n-1)*p(n-1) + ... + a(n-k)*p(n-k)`
        - the formula is a bit more complicated because it requires
          mixing the image data from deep dream and the raw video
          frames or some intermediate frames
   - then the application would adjust the weights for regions of
     space that more confidently identified a representation of the
     data with the ability to modulate the feedback loop from Deep
     Dream's representation back into the video moving forward when
     there are stronger persistence values.

- now apply to smooth fractal transformation video & persist the
  accurate DD representations
  - what happens?
  - Deep Dream's inferences about a trained class's representation in
    some specific area feeds back into itself when it's very confident
    and those areas are scaled up to match Deep Dream's inferences for
    several frames worth of persistences
    - this results in an increase in volume for several feedback
      loops.
  - so a representation of the trained class becomes visible to the
    user, but then because it should even more strongly match the
    training class, sufficiently strong representations that emerge
    should tend to persist until they are disrupted by large changes
    in the video stream
  - what does this give you? a mathematic way of tracking spatial
    inferences over time and associating classes of data to a
    particular region of space.
  - *that is, pixar or dreamworks could layer in deep dream effects to
    regions of 3D space that can move, but remain distinct from other
    areas of the 2D or 3D space*
    - so, the deep dream can effect regions of video *logically* in a
      way that shouldn't require much configuration
- this technique is very similar to what is used in this video on
  [Deep Dream Processing for Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgPaCWJL7XI),
  - the idea I describe above differs in the prioritization and
    persistence of strong matches over time.
    - ideally, the design should try to "clear" registered inferences
      on regions of video X/Y space over time unless there is a strong
      match.
    - it should also be able to track inferences over time even though
      their shape may mutate from frame to frame
    - and optimally, the system should allow tracking multiple
      inferences in overlapping spatiotemporal slices of video
      (X/Y/T), but that seems more difficult

### Composite Manifold for reduction of (n+k)-d spaces to n-d spaces

- the way i'm imagining this, it's either a pretty amazing loophole
  for a lossless means of encoding elements of a space into fewer
  dimensions *without any loss of information*
  - this doesn't really seem possible, intuitively, because it would
    be magical and would likely break things.
  - however, it might just an interesting idea that allows you to use
    the Apollonian gasket to structure algebraic manifolds that can be
    used in conjunction with dimensionality reduction techniques like
    PCA and others.
    - dimensionality reduction almost always results in:
      - destruction of information or a loss in the
        precision/linearity of the space
      - increased difficulty in making linear assumptions about data
        in the flattened dimensions,
      - changes in the algebraic structure of tensors of previous or
        subsequent operations
      - the need to treat the flattened dimensions with constraints on
        values or the space
  - this is why, if you can hack some self-similar structure into
    giving you lossless dimensionality reduction, it would be useful
    and interesting.
    - this is similar to what the hopf fibration accomplishes in
      mapping surfaces of high dimensional spheres onto the fibration
      of non-internsecting k-spheres on a n+k-sphere (i think those
      details are correct)
    - yet, the hopf fibration is limited and only works in FOUR
      pairings of n-spheres. according to Adam's Theorum, the four
      mappings correspond to the "real division algebras" for each of
      real, complex, quaternian and octonian numbers... this thing
      seems pretty important for numbers and math generally.
      - i.e. there are only four of them.
    - i have a lot to learn, but it seems like something would prevent
      what i'm thinking about from working out entirely, even though
      it's mostly completely unrelated to the actual specifics of Hopf
      Fibrations.

- i misunderstood some aspects of the Hopf Fibration, but this lead me
  to try to imagine a packing of spheres
  - either an Apollonian packing or a packing that is inferred from
    some ideal features or proportions of the containing space.
    - so [this paper](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~dpapp/pub/nilgeo_proc.pdf)
      refers to "Nil geodesics" which seem visually similar to what i
      imagined the arrangment of the initial spheres to be.
      - what i was thinking about would use something like "nil
        geodesics" but would map the interior of the space of some
        object so that an infinite Apollonian Gasket would result in a
        hyperbolic space that was "ideal" in some way but would also
        offer structure,
    - e.g. such structure would lead to a topological arrangement of
      the set of spheres in the Apollonian gasket that would preserve
      meaningful relationships, such as the level of the sphere
      - also, since here we are working with real numbers, a singular
        value suffices as the metric need to transform a specific
        sphere in the gasket to the 'unit sphere'
      - if your sphere packing is the typically Apollonian gasket,
        even it the hyperbolic space is slightly deformed in some way,
        each sphere is 'retrivable' by indexes associate with spheres
        at each level
  - how would you use such structure? if you can assume a standard,
    centered Apollonian gasket inside a sphere, then you can say all
    spheres of level 2 are 'coverings' or charts to a manifold in the
    same n dimensions or possibly even a higher dimension.
    - similarly you can say that all spheres of level 3 or some
      fractal branch k in the appolonian gasket map to different
      aspects of a lossy dimensionality reduction (or lossless?
      fingers crossed)
  - these internalized spheres map to charts on an atlas for some
    manifold, which essentially provides (non)smooth covering for that
    space within a lower dimension.
    - so, there is structure inherent in the set-topology of spheres
      or inherent in the self-similar fractal nature of the Apollonian
      gasket.
      - it's this structure that specifies how these charts come
        together to form an atlas for the manifold. I'm not sure
        whether its uncountable

- it's almost magic bc everything is fucking spheres and it doesn't
  matter how small they get because it's fucking real numbers.
  - (although, this 'composite manifold idea' is probably not even a
    useful technique or may be incapable of behaving in the way i am
    imagining)
  - but what do discs and spheres give us? mobious transformations.
    - so it doesn't matter what kinds of spaces each sphere maps to OR
      whether that space is big or small.
    - i'm not very familiar with mobious transformations, but they
      enable manifolds that map the unit disc (& n-sphere) to any convex

- higher order structures for this apollonian packing manifold that
  remove the finite constraints of the top level sphere.
  - when you start moving "up" with the apollonian gasket, these
    structures are usually uncountable
  - spiral structures can be imagined, with spheres being packed
    outwards. then the normal fractal packings of spheres can extend
    in the spaces between.
  - some of these structures have countable arrangements.

# Ir/Rationality

### Rationality and Linear Algebra

#### Comparison of Rational Numbers (and algebraics) with the Reals

- Within (Rational #s), there's always assoc
  - since only one can be true, thus `xor3(a,b,c)` or `&& (popcount == 1))`
    1. a set `(a in Q)` s.t. `(a < x)` (xor3)
    1. a set `(b in Q)` s.t. `(b > x)` (xor3)
    1. a single `(c in Q)` s.t. `(c == x)`

- But when comparing (x in Q# to y in R#'s) only one of two can be
  true:
  - (x != y) thus (y not in (x's set))
    1. a set (a in Q) s.t. (a < y)
    1. a set (b in Q) s.t. (b > y)
  - this second point (x in Q# and y in R#) is interesting when also
    connecting to linear algebra and surfaces of hermitian & unitary
    matrices of various dimensionality's and lie algebra (crystals)

- these points can also be connected to concentric groupings of
  rationals and increasingly algebraic numbers

- only a rational `(a in Q)` can be specified in terms of `(a * i)`
  - where `a := (n/m)` and `(n,m,i in Z)`
  - interesting stuff can be done here, but there are limited numbers
    of lattices & crystals that can be formed which allow functoral
    transformation to equations with *some* irrational eccentricity
    - regular tilings on the 2D plane are ways of mapping:
      - `(x,y in Z)` to a restricted subset of `(x,y in (Z || Q ||
        R))` ... i.e. usually, the Rationals/Reals, `but also
        concentrically algebraic sets along various axes`)
        - but also, (m/n) values can be applied along lattice
          deformations along the axis in multiple dimensions
  - but (holding the above lie algebra tangent off until below)...
    - can any Q be specified in terms of

- also rational numbers have a structure with a surface to it
  - and these surfaces interconnect to irrational numbers through phi
    (the "last" rational number and the "most irrational number")
    - -Inf <=> phi^n <=> phi^1 <=> phi^0 <=> 0 <=> phi^0 <=> phi^1 <=>
      phi^n
      - (but doesn't and needs to account for -(phi^(n/m)))
  - but anyways, this sets up something similar to galois theory, but
    for irrationals and grounds it as a series of interconnecting
    surfaces on high-dimensional crystals
    - these (i think?) form lattices, upon which equations and
      deformations can be specified.
      - if they don't fit, the interactions can be "lifted" to other
        (exactly? or sufficiently?) equivalent spaces
      - (is this right?) so in other words, interactions on one
        "shape" of lattice can be lifted to another position on the
        same/different lattice type/shape
      - but in high dimensions and certain configurations (d8/e8)
        special properties emerge(?) for the equations and
        transformations/morphisms on & between each configuration(?)

- galois, special groups, lie algebras and differential equations
  - differential equations and the concept of (Q/R) algebraicity
    - do diff-eq's allow any inferences about their evolving
      solution-space that take into account rationality, periodicity
      and algebraicity of the numbers and equations?
      - i.e. using galois theory, lie algebra, and probabilistic
        inference etc to cause current observations for diff-eq
        systems to "Snap To" a lattice
  - the "param-space" intersection of two like types in some
    (direct-product or direct-sum of reals or hermition sym. spaces)
    - that is, when diff-eq's are created from the (sum/product) of
      equations based on other parameters
      - these new equations will exert the same intricate
        phenomenological curiosities (in rationals/reals/lattices/etc)
        as other diff-eq's but will somehow have to account for the
        intersection (viz. sum/product) of these types
  - what does this say about possible initial values for systems
    defined by differential equations?
    - that is, given the periodicity (in reals by rationals in a
      lattice) of values from observations, can some inferences be
      made that filter the space of possibilities for the
  - how do gauss-bonnet, euler's number and changes in topology factor
    into this?
    - that is, if you have sudden change in increasingly local
      topologies that exerts effect on equations (via dissipation of
      gauss-bonnet of topological holes over large spaces)
      - how does *this* phenomenon relate to the representations of
        equations on lattices, esp. as it relates to diff-eq (like
        gravity)
    - if there is some fundamental speed limit for state propagation
      in the curved space, how are these topological deformations
      propagated?


### Continuous Fractions as a Basis for Number/Coordinate System

- continued fractions can be used to index ANY real number, even
  irrational numbers.

- phi is the prototypical continued fraction and the identity
  operation mapped to the identity value on some kind of group related
  to continuous fractions.

- are there means of measuring the aleph degree of continued fractions?
  - coordinate planes and spaces for continuous fractions?
    - connections to the hyperbolic plane?
  - phi should be the origin of such spaces of graphing continuous
    fractions ... or should it be, if it's the identity?

- what is `X = 0 + (0 + 1/(0 + (1/...)))`
  - this or some simliar definition may have a connection to infinity

- continued fractions are basically glorified long division with a
  baseless number system
  - this is why phi is the *most irrational* number, which has been
    studied, because it's definition has the most parity

- from a continued fraction definition where the numerators are
  indexed by n and valued as (X1 ... Xn), examine such a definition of
  phi: can any equivalent values be determined by fixpoint most values
  of Xn and combinating values of the rest?
  - i.e. can you have some continued fraction that definitively
    equates to another, similarly structured continued fraction?
  - this is similar to what i ask below when discussing lie algebra
    for continued fractions

### Continued Fractions and Group Theory

- several important properties hold for phi and continued fractions
  - there are group theory connections here
  - e.g. the definition of phi holds for division or roots
- these can be described as groups
  - {phi, cont(+,sqrt)}
  - {phi, cont(+,*)}
  - ... the notation is horribly incorrect
  - and these are necessarily groups with infinite domains
- what arithmetic rules are allowed when using continued roots or
  continued fractions?
  - what rules allow you to rearrange a formula?
  - and why? this is where understanding a kind of group theory
    interpretation of the structure of continued statements is
    important.

#### phi defined from continued division

```
phi = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(...)))
```

### phi defined from continued roots

```
phi = 1 + (1 + (1 + (1 + (...)^(1/n))^(1/n))^(1/n))
```

- for the above definition, are there imaginary & quaternary solutions
  or aspects to this definition?
  - or does this mean they don't hold the same properties? (...??)
  - Phi(n), Phi(n,m), Phi(n,m,p) (referring to variables in continued
    roots formula ?)
  - crossovers to polynomials?
  - crossovers to group theory with phi(n) and chained/braided groups
  - (not really sure where i was going with some of this)

- how do complex numbers tie into a study of groups modeled with
  continuous fractions

### Lie Algebra for Continued Fractions

- lie algebra on the continued fraction structure for phi.
  - can you anticipate the effect that small transformations of values
    at indices (i, j, ...) have on the actual values encoded by the
    value of the continued fraction.
  - phi is the protypical example. all the numerators are
    one. therefore, when changing one or two of those values, certain
    value shifts with predictable structure should emerge.
    - the "kind" of structure in value shifts here is similar to those
      algebraic manipulations b/w groups studied by lie algebra.
    - if there is preservation of structure, then even if the
      structure itself is ineffable, there should be many
      opportunities for study here.
      - is there preservation of structure when mutating numerators at
        multiple indices when those indices are selected to satisfy
        specific properties?
        - e.g. if distance(i,j) == d, how does the structure/behavior
          change as i & j increase when the distance is constant?
- (lie algebra IS related to the recursive definition of algebraic
  numbers and, in so is probably also related to Surreal numbers and
  numbers represented by continued fractions)
  - actually... do infinite continued fractions necessarily have a
    finite algebraic number representation (viz. a polynomic
    representation of some finite degree)
    - now that i think about it, the definition of phi, in terms of
      recursive square roots IS the definition of an "infinite"
      polynomial (i think)

### Pi as Continued Fractions

- pi as continued fractions:
  - patterns of primes in numerators/denominators?
    - used for narrowing a search on pi or predicting primes or
      spacing the domains/parameters used to discover new primes
    - and if the patterns of primes in these functions can be used to
      narrow search for pi, then each can be used cyclicly to discover
      the other. i.e. pi helps identify candidate large primes and
      large primes help narrow the real, continued fraction region of
      pi, which must be resolved to contain new, unknown primes.
  - the challenge of course is how to do that, exactly. how do you
    capture the structures of all these definitions and then use
    them mathematically to compare against each other.
    - then how do you design the software to use this information?

- there are many ways of writing pi as continued fractions, as noted
  on the
  [Wolfram page](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PiContinuedFraction.html)

- surreal numbers X continued fractions
  - is there a useful connection to surreal numbers when trying to
    create a system of mapping all real numbers with continued
    fractions?

- isnt a rational number a special case of the real numbers that
  should satisfy some conditions when indexed to be written as a
  continued fraction?
  - i.e. if rational numbers can all be written as m/n, then what does
    that mean for the structure/values of their continued fractional
    form?
  - is there some measure of irrationality? are there some numbers
    that are more irrational than others?

#### Biwabik Sum (pi and phi)

- (2014) combine the "Biwabik Sum", an infinite expansion that defines
  pi in terms of phi, w/ the bizarre formula that says (12 = 1+2+3+4)
  - this could potentially relate to pi, phi and e



### Comparison of Pi as Infinite Series

- [Liebniz Formula for Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80)
  - this definition of pi alternates, as does `e`. however, not every
    numeric definition of pi alternates before converging.
  - this formula, an infinite sum, can be converted to an infinite
    product, called a Euler product
    - tangent: analog of euler product & dirichlet series for continued fractions?

![Comparison of Pi as Infinite Series](/img/posts/matroids/comparison-of-pi-infinite-series.png)

- this picture from wikipedia visually compares several iterative methods for approximating pi
  - [Viete's Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi%C3%A8te%27s_formula)
    for 2/pi uses an infinite product of continued radicals
  - [Wallace Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product)
    uses an infinite product to generate pi/2

- with a glance at the article for
  [Van Wijngaarden transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Wijngaarden_transformation),
  the method i am thinking about for pi seems very similar.

### Analytical Analysis of Digits in Transendental Numbers derived by various methods

- attempt to resolve the "final" value of pi or any transcendental
  number that converges into a simple limit by using the formula for
  the transcendental number approximated in many different number
  systems.

- so, to calculate a better resolution of e, you do your calculations
  and store the results in each of base-2, base-3, base-5, base-7,
  etc number systems.
  - only base-p numbering systems are used, where p is prime.
  - you end up with a value for e in base-2, base-3, base-5, etc
  - from here, you can run analytical methods to identify patterns in
    the various encodings of the transcendental numbers
    - you're looking for patterns in the digits of e or pi in
      different numbering systems.

- several processes for generating e or pi could be used. the
  traditional definition of pi is a good example for illustrating the
  values that are convoluted:
  - start with a 3-side regular polygon, progress to an n-gon and
    calculate ratio of circumference to radius
  - convolute the differences in values returned from (n-100, n-10, n,
    n+10, n+100) to infer linear bounds on the final value of pi
  - for convergent methods of generating pi, you need n to be a series
    of adjacent integers

- k differentiated e[j,k] approximations are produced for j
  approximations of e (what exactly is k again?)
  - k can be several diffferent things, stored approximations,
    differences between approximations, etc.
- for the ever-expanding set of e[j,k] approximations,
  multi-dimensional runga-kutta is used to interpolate (n * |e[j,k])
  estimates of e in n-prime-base systems
  - from here, one can observe the change in bounds of estimates
    treating them all as linear bounding functions that can be
    sequentially joined

- one can extend this to pi or can augment the analytical analysis of
  digits with e*pi, pi^n, e*n
  - the main idea is to take data from the infinite process of
    resolving values for e, pi that gives you an indication of how
    wrong each method is at each step
    - and convoluting that data to construct a much more efficient
      means of arriving at a more precise value for e or pi faster.
  - the main question is, could any such convolutional process be
    faster than the simpler infinite process? there may be some
    surprising numerical insight that creates a shortcut for resolving
    these numbers... or maybe not

- one could take the error for values returned for pi or e and
  construct high-dimensional polynomial/multinomial distributions
  - these distributions could enable you to guess how likely you are
    to converge towards pi or e faster using some kind of gradient
    descent
  - the methods that would be most useful here are the convergent
    methods for approaching pi, not the asymptotic methods.
  - but since you're trying to identify a singular value of pi, the
    error generated by multiple convergent methods essentially narrows
    the search space or pi (or whichever transcendental)

### Polynomial Coordinate System to Bridge Irrationality & Rationality

- this idea probably needs a lot of work
- polynomial-based coordinate system with e, pi, phi and 1
  - essentially a numbering system based on polynomials of e/pi/etc...

### Geometric Mechanics and Entropy

- relationship b/w (1) the degrees of freedom for components in a
  geometric mechanical system and (2) the distribution/entropy of
  potential/kinetic energy in the system
  - i.e. do the mechanics of intersections b/w components,
    (kinematically), lead to inferences about the distribution of
    potential/kinetic energy? about the dynamics of energy in the
    system, as it relates to the components?
    - vice versa: can the dynamics of energy and measurements about
      potential/kinetic energy lead to inferences about geometric
      mechanical relationships among components?
  - of course these relationships exist b/w energy, components and the
    mechanics of a system. but what can be inferred?

### Continuum Hypothesis

- implications of continuum hypothesis and the fluidity of "Infinite
  Infinities" for GodelCP & strategies for proofs by induction
  (Fermat's)
  - what did I mean by "Infinite Infinities"? I think I meant the
    structure and variation of uncountable infinities.
- implications of Godel's Completeness Theorum for Automated Theorum
  Proving (they're not good. ATP is rendered very intractible, I
  think)

### Spectral Data Analysis

- spectral data science on time series data (e.g. financial) comparing
  several models using:
  - many `signals` & `∂-signals`
  - composition & decompositions of `signals` & `∂-signals`
  - `FFT` & `∂-FFT` & spectral analysis
  - along with predictive tools like Runge-Kutta
  - All of the above is fairly basic spectral analysis, but the point
    is to train tradings algorithm to extend the Runge-Kutta
    predictions forward further, all of the above techniques can be
    combined to understand the most likely curves from the current
    signals
    - because Fourier is a linear operator, then:
      - `FFT(∂-signal) = ∂-FFT(signal)`, the spectrum of the
        differentiated signal is equivalent to the differentiation of
        the spectrum of the signal
      - this property is very useful for time series analysis,
        especially when combined with some multiplication operation
        `⊗` and multiple signals
      - thus, `FFT(∂-s1 ⊗ ∂-s2) = ∂-FFT(s1 ⊗ s2)`, which is subject to
        some constraints for the particular multiplication function to
        be sure
  - to learn how to predict the signal, an algorithm would assume that
    most every influence is external,
    - then using something like Runge-Kutta & machine learning to
      predict groups of trading decisions,
    - then follows the profit/loss of these decisions & (and trades by
      adding the `∂-signal` only {what did i mean by this?})
  - it then tries to identify the influence of unknown external
    factors by trying to predict the spectral differences in the
    prediction when compared to actual results
    - so, it has some set of features (the external factors) it's
      trying to learn and can accept as input
    - it looks at the history of trades, both its own and from other
      brokers on the market
    - and it then tries to correlate the time series of the features,
      with the asset price signals, along with its model's prediction
      for that price signal.
      - and critically, it wants to compare `∂-model` and `∂-signal`
      - so, `model` and `∂-model` would give many potential signals
        from `t := now`. these are possible paths predicted by trained
        models for a specific price signal
      - then it compares those to the actual signal to adjust values
        for trading.

# Geometry


- "Euler's number for a surface's polytoroidal parameterization"
  - that's the note, literally. i can't remember what it was, exactly.
    - "Euler's number (X) a surface's polytoroidal parameterization"
  - for every 3D surface, no matter how many holes it has, there is a
    parameterization into a 2D surface.
    - this is the "pant's theorum" => toroi with many holes can be
      decomposed into 2D surfaces that can be stitched together.
    - the idea i was thinking about had something to do with using
      euler's number to make inferences about the placement of "pants"
      - it had something to do with making a leap b/w 3D and 2D
      - it may have been about moving around an infinite space or a
        space with unknown size, and inferring the parameterization of
        the local region of space from the euler's number (& vice
        versa)

### Metroid =~ Matroid Connection

- what is the connection here? or does the metaphor break down?
- every greedy optimization problem has a matroid representation
  - scheduling computation is a greedy optimization problem, but
    greedy optimization is heuristic/stochastic. it's not necessarily
    correct.
  - [Signal Recovery From Random Measurements via OMP]()
    - OMP is a greedy algorithm and they all have matroid
      representations. are matroids therefore critical in signal
      recovery for high-dimensional data?
      - what do the matroid representations for the OMP greedy
        algorithm look like? how do they correlate to signal recovery
        and signal representation?
      - look into "atomic" representation of signal (where correlation
        is identified in n-dimensional input, but approximated with a
        more logical and less "linear algebraic" representation)
    - how do you discover the structure of the matroid? or is the
      greedy algorithm essentially uncovering the structure of a
      matroid, which itself *is* the basis for the heuristic that
      delivers the expected best return?
    - are there energy bounds on the computation therein? Or am i
      trying too hard to get the metaphor to fit?

Sound like a leap to conclusions that your traditional schizophrenic
makes by inferrring the presence of arbitrary semio-linguistic
connections *that don't exist*? Ok, that's fair because it does sound
crazy. However you can, forget that linguistic connection because it's
stupid, arbitrary and trivial. Instead, read this excerpt from an
abstract on the subject.[^matroid-algorithm-computational-oracles]

#### From: [Complexity of Matroid Property Algorithms](https://doi.org/10.1137/0211014)

It means that algorithms requiring matroids are NOT computationally
friendly. Matroids eat all your energy. Algorithmic oracles, like
[padding
oracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack), exist
as helpful shortcuts that can be leveraged to assert whether your
computations are proceeding in the correct direction or your algorithm
needs to take an entirely different direction.

If you don't understand, what that means is that America has gangraped
an Einstein on the floor of a train to Dashau. I should have a job. I
should be very, very successful. Instead, I'm expected to fucking work
at a McDonald's. Not only do I understand the 1,000 ft view of the
above, I can extrapolate the consequences phenomenologically and
sociologically. Someone else already did. This isn't a great example,
but when I independently uncover something that someone else has
already discovered -- *in public academia* -- then I am humiliated for
it, while being degraded, emotionally tormented and psychological
tortured in front of others:

#### I never get taken seriously in a very public way to encourage other people less knowledgable from ever taking me seriously.

### I never get job offers; any career that doesn't involve asking people "Do you want fries with that?" has been prematurely terminated.

#### And above all else, I never get social interaction with people who know what i'm talking about. That is a very high priority for people who want to keep me down.

- Why is this particular connection to matroids useful?
  - connect matroids to financial trading algorithms and sociophysical
    algorithms.
