### Common to most developments

- apartment development can be staged, somewhat
- in any ccase, it would be good to be able to develop the back a bit
  and toss out the tax credit, but that's probably not going to happen
  - that is, while preserving the historic nature & identity of the
    building
- Live Oaks already has plans in motion for this building and will
  expand in salem with other developments.
  - i have no idea what their portfolio of assets in salem is, but i
    know they have a ton of real estate holdings & businesses in the
    greater roanoke area.
  - and they have a lot of clout/influence via social networks of
    the business/entrepreneurial community in roanoke.
    - they may have a plurality of social capital in specific
      aspects/networks of roanoke's entrepreneurial community

### Mostly apartments

- 10-12+ apartments + 2,000 - 4,000 sqft restaurant
- would be developed quickly, to establish revenue streams
- adds local economic value to DT salem proportional to ~avgIncome
  - terribly general estimation, but at 8 apartments with avgIncome
    $60,000 at $1,000/unit results in living expenses of $1,500, with
    some proportion of some $2-3000 remaining. roughly $24,000*ki
    annual contribution, where ki is proportion of disposable income
    spent locally. the numbers are probably a bit better than that.
- there is definitely a need for apartments
  - but this building is certainly unique, spacious and could be
    otherwise developed.

### half & half

- i think this is the best case, but partnering with the developer to
  share the space for creative/community/diverse purposes will be
  tough.
  - they could otherwise start collecting revenue streams from ~6+
    apartments by Jan/Aug 2018
- ~7,000 sqft (approx) for less than 10 apartments
  - less than contractually defined number of apartments
  - can require renegotiation of contract to open up terms.
- any apartment development precludes some use cases for the bottom
  floor. a music venue is great, but they're probably not going to
  pump borgore at 1:30 am. also, snyder's is across the street.
  - the noise issues are pretty trivial concerns to get around, with
    capital and creativity

### full community

- requires an immense amount of cash
  - more risk for Live Oaks
  - requires more time for customization of development
  - more complexity
  - less time to act, clear opportunity loss of > $50k in 2018
- it's possible the current developer would be willing to build the
  space out for community utilization, but it seems like they are
  ready to start to reclaim investment costs.
- in order to do this all the way and make it appealing for the
  current developer, the building should ideally be bought back.
  - the total cost would be:
    - $400k+ in financing to cover building
    - cost for refurbishments
    - $100k-500k in capital to prep space for specific developments &
      other costs, for which I have no data to back up. Just an early
      rough estimate.
  - the asset was bought for ~$400,000 and speculation over usage may
    add to value.
    - so you will need to pay more to cover this.
    - this means someone buys the asset and is less concerned with
      immediate return on investment.
    - it needs a ton of maintainence
  - further, the cost to develop one or multiple highly customized
    spaces increases, with the number of spaces and requirements of
    each
    - this is complex and requires at least one full-time
      employee/volunteer, plus vetting business plans, logistic
      complexity with an increased number of spaces.
  - one needs to decide on the organizational structure of the
    project. i.e. business/non-profit/etc and how the owner relates to
    the groups/interests utilizing the space
  - then there's investment for developing the space.
    - if it's all one organization, they have to finance it all.
    - if it's multiple organizations leasing/contracting to utilize
      the space, then the logistic complexity increases
      combinatorially
      - (owner <=> interests <=> (banks & business/community parters))
- the building's usage as a community center would draw crowds to
  salem, but may not be operational in this capacity until at least
  2019.

- there's nothing that says salem can't have a community center
  somewhere close by. although the historic identity and design of the
  building match usage for arts, music and events.

- this direction allows the space to be used in any way possible
  - but because of the complexity and time constraints, it may be
    better to build a project like this elsewhere in downtown salem,
    which will eventually expand from across thompson mem. to chestnut
    - so there's still the possibility to build something for cheaper,
      with more time to explore options that anchors on the west end
      of DT salem.
    - IMHO, the ideal positions for anchors in a small city DT with
      plenty of infill & redevelopable space to expand:
      - in the middle
      - and, starting with the opposite ends of main st, in the
        periphery, later expanding to push perpindicular to main st.
      - this sets up a set of hotspots to encourage flux of
        pedistrian/etc traffic
        - by positioning on the outside, a bit further beyond flux
          hotspots, it should increase the social flux and asset
          values of property b/w the anchors
        - then, developers and economic interests gradually push out
          around these anchors
    - but a small city with undeveloped infills/etc has a predefined
      limit on expansions without significant costs
      - these costs of redevelopment mean you essentially buy the
      property as building + land price
      - and you hope to outweigh the building cost with clearly
        demonstrable economic value
      - so you want to keep developments within defined revitalization
        zones (DBD & TBD zones in salem)
      - the goal is to optimize the quality and quantity of
        social/financial flux within the total downtown area without
        increasing it so much that it decreases investment &
        ROI-potential, with respect to area.
      - and it seems like salem has a good plan for that, though some
        interests disagree on the direction
