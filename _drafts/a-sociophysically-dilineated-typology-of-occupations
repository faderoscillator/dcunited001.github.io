# Occupations, Typologically Delineated Along (Sociophysical Aspects)

- title: occupations?

### A typology of jobs from a social physics perspective

- how to choose an occupation based on maximizing social physical
  preferences:
  - targeted demographic,
  - varied demographics,
  - more control over dynamically targetable demographic,
  - high flux of particles/people
  - highly varied flux of particles/people

### Objectives Someone Might Want to Achieve Via Their Occupation

- limit total social exposure over time
- develop their own social graph
- encounter local graph flux

### Salesman

- success very much depends on social physics

- many factors distort the experience of someone in sales
  - quality of product, market share, competitiveness
    - the pricing structure and the response
  - marketing/branding and advertisement performance
  - sociophysical aspects

- paradox where a sales role w/ product that hardly sells itself
  produces a job with very different performance requirements &
  responsibilities
  - might be more challenging to sell.
    - it might just
      be that your product is demonstrably
