# Do Gravitational Fields Exhibit Skyrmionic Quantum Effects

- got these idea from
  [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01101), which references
  skyrmions & gravitational fields but w/ no references to EM fields
  or magnetism

### Gravitational Skyrmions in Stars?

- so, if there are skyrmionic effects from quantum effects in the
  gravitational fields influence on matter, where would they emerge?
  - skyrmions only emerge under specific conditions in specific
    materials, presenting slightly different effects when cooled with
    FC & ZFC
  - if a similar phenomenon would occur from quantum gravity's effect
    on matter, when given the chance for the correct conditions to
    emerge, where would it emerge and what would it look like?

### What Shapes and Structures Do Gravitational Skyrmions Present Themselves In

- need to become more confident on the 3D structure/presentation of
  skyrmionic 'filaments'
  - need to read more info on this

- do the same filament-like effects emerge in gravitational fields
  - i think the shape/form of these effects would be profoundly
    different
  - spacetime curvature via mass is monopolar and spheroidal
    - EM force is dipolar
  - also, large celestial bodies constantly move through warped
    spacetime, thus its difficult to control/zero out the
    gravitational field, like the EM field in a lab
    - however, bc they are always moving through
      - are microgravitational changes detectable with geostationary
        satellites? similar to the micro-scale variance on the surface
        of earth (higher where there's water, lower at the poles)

- the quantum-mechanical effcts causing EM skyrmions are still
  present, even at high temperatures, but since the system is chaotic,
  thus a crystal's magnetic lattice nodes don't stack their EM field
  effects
  - and their electrical influence on neighboring nodes is more
    chaotic and rapidly moving nuclei (center of mass) causes
    (slight?) dispersion of charge density
    - that is, as the nuclei of ferromagnetic and other particles move
      around, their change in center of mass also correlates to a
      change in the "center" of positive charge density (via protons)
      - also causes chaotic effects on local waves of kinetic energy
    - this causes aberrent electron motion, which means the electrons
      of crystal lattice neighbors are less likely to be in sync
  - the point is: even with some thermal activity, the quantum
    mechanical effects are still there. what should show up instead
    are slight variations b/w what is predicted by quantum & classical
    thermodynamics:
    - for solid-state crystals with ferromagnetic lattice nodes above
      skyrmionic phase temperatures (50K < T < 150K), there should be
      slight aberrations b/w what is predicted by classical
      thermodynamics and what is observed, which represents the system
      "absorbing" those influneces, in a way
      - however, the scale of that aggregate variance is unclear, as
        is how it might be measured. it would likely be more prominent
        in systems with magnetism than without
        - and more prominent closer to phase change boundaries or when
          phonons ripple through the crystal

- however, if EM skyrmion phases only emerge at specific temperatures
  & magnetizations, then how would this be analogous for gravity
  - for any experiments, this could be a major bummer
    - for EM skyrmions, lower crystal temperatures and lower
  - depending on the scale of quantum gravity's effects, thermal
    motion would almost certainly cancel out their effect
    - this is what happens for EM skyrmions: raise the temperature too
      high and ferromagnetic atoms in the lattice lose their local
      electrical properties that contributes towards precise EM
      distortions

- if there is some coupling b/w the gravity & the EM force
  - then gathering skyrmionic data while controlling relativistic
    state might cause anomolous variation to emerge in skyrmioinc
    measurements
  - i don't believe this "Grand Unified Theory" coupling exists, but
    that Gravity is almost completely separate from the other three
    forces, which operate within spacetime
  - even still, some variation in skyrmionic data must emerge that may
    act as a kind of microscope into gravities influence
  - if there are some kind of

#### Can Skyrmionic effects present evidence of Chronons, Quantum Time or Quantum temporal effects?

- can an experiment be designed to encourage materials presenting EM
  field skyrmionic effects to also indicate evidence of chronons or
  quantum time?
  - perhaps by altering the rate of skyrmionic phase change by
    modulating temperature
  - or the methods or by triggering frequent transitions and types of
    transitions between skyrmionic phase changes

- if using an electron beam, modulating distance, path, beam
  orientation.
  - this known variance helps infer
  - photons could be used instead of raw electrons, which hit some
    local intermediary device on the surface of the satellite,
    transforming them into electrons
    - this way, polarization, slitting and other types of modulations
      can be used to introduce randomization into the data
      - whenever randomization can be added/inferred to an experiment,
        but its value can be known, this can be inductively &
        deductively harnessed to resolve more detail in
        trends/dynamics or at least increase confidence

#### photonic modulation

- beam splitting:
  - to locally alter trajectory of photons received
- inferometry:
  - to produce quantum entanglement effects in photons
- beam polarization:
- beam distance:
- beam path:
- beam origin: earth, solar, satellite

#### modulation of photon to election transduction

- "transparency" => multiple layers of skyrmionic detection arrays
  - this is critical (...)

#### EM modulation

#### skyrmionic modulation

- crystal type:
  - what specific chemical formula for skyrmionic activity
  - (e.g. ???)
- crystal composition:
  - concentration of ferromagnetic components in the crystal
- skyrmionic phase type:
- skyrmionic phase value:
  - EM Field Strength (mT) & temperature (K)
  - modulate various values of a crystal simultaneously
    - this causes deformation of electron path
- can phonons ripple through the crystal?
  - would these local distortions be useful?


#### Space-based Skyrmionic measurement of Quantum Gravity & Quantum Temporal Effects

- what would happen to these experiments in space? if quantum
  temporal effects do emerge and do exist, would relativistic
  effects cause them to present differences?


- a massively parallel, space-based skyrmionic detection device could
  harness relativistic effects (special & general) to compel the
  emergence of quantum gravity effects or quantum temporal effects
  - relativistic effects possible in space should force subtle
    skyrmionic data, especially for cells of various crystal types
    - i.e. beams of electrons fired from various distances at a
      satellite with skyrmion-detection equipment (viz. large-scale
      convergent beam electron diffaction (CBEM) or some other new
      means of detection)
    - the beta particles (electrons) used to hit the skyrmion
      detection device hit the device in a manner where each type of
      crystals' skyrmionic effects can be maintained
    - several options here, but the key is that
      - (1) this could be done with a pair of satellites (GEO & HEO,
        or GEO & Heliocentric or HEO & Heliocentric),
        - perhaps an existing satellite or ISS could be modified to
          send/receive input
      - (2) use the ISS, or some single HEO/heliocentric satellite,
        with the intent of absorbing electrons into something like a
        giant solar sail repurposed for skyrmionic detection
        - electron source:
          - use an electron beam from another satellite
          - beta particles from solar weather events
        - with this setup, many crystal types with various magnetic
          material compositions/concentrations can be used
          simultaneously
          - with the right experimental methodology, arrays of
            millions of cells for skyrmionic detection can
            simultaneously gather correlated(!) input
            - the arrays must have multiple layers and allow some
              particles to pass through
              - to resolve imaging of quantum effects
          - each crystal type & material concentration can be used
            simultaneously produce many different points/phases in
            skyrmionic
          - furthermore, the EM properties, FC/ZFC cooling method, and
            temperature can simultaneously be modulated to measure
            data for various phase types, phase type values, and
            active skyrmionic phase transitions/deformations
            - for values in a skyrmionic phase, values should be
              modulated for [B(mT), T(K)]
            - the skyrmionic state for crystals can alter between
              phase transitions, so that more complex electron paths
              can be calculated, yielding more inference into
              potential quantum gravity or quantum temporal effects
          - various material concetrations allows
      - (3) use some multiple set of HEO/heliocentric satellites with
        a similar setup to #2 that can process beta particles from the
        same solar weather events, but at different speeds


#### Unexplained Phenomena in the Solar System And Universe...

- that could exhibit quantum gravity effects (especially skyrmionic)

- are lower temperatures required for QG effects to emerge?
  - if so, potentially effects in gas clouds?
  - i don't think we will see these QG skrymionic effects emerge in
    the same way they do for EM skyrmions
  - it's more likely that we could identify the aggregate variance
    - if so, then mass/energy/density/lifecycle/etc along with strong
      short-term changes in curved spacetime may correlate with
      variance in this aggregate QG effect


- unexplained phenomena at the core of stars:
  - interactions b/w element shells at core
    - charge/pressure/gravity/etc in various areas of the sun
    - when matter is extremely densely packed like this, especially w/
      predominantly positive charge and electrical flux
    - the more (tight the packing) and the more dense the elements at
      that shell mean ... (more restricted motion?)
      - {... i'm way out of my league here}
    - electrical flux through the core would need to be locally
      intense to alter nuclei packing.
      - electrical flux and its corresponding motion of elements
        should reflect their ~2000(n):1 mass difference in
        nuclei/electrons), where n is the atomic mass
    - .... however, with increasing density comes increasing potential
      for positively charged nuclei to repel each other
  - does near-zero gravity at the center of a star mean that quantum
    effects are more likely to emerge here?

- unexpectedly high levels of elements, or higher than normal
  - the above dynamics should cause

- anomolous dynamics in supernovas (... how exactly?)
  - [Collapsing stars, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts](http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~thj/popular/Collapsing_stars.html)
    - cool pictures. need more information about problems modeling
      supernovae.
  - watch lectures like these on
    [supernovae simulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfQiizUdi0g)
  - [Helioseismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helioseismology)

- micro blackholes? i'm sure this has been studied for QG

- spectral variance in x-ray & gamma-ray radiation in pulsars close
  enough to do spatially derived hyperspectral analysis
  - energy & esp frequency must be high so the wavelength is small
    enough that local spacetime changes influence the spectra
    - how would this work to measure the aggregate variance?
  - this doesn't work because curved spacetime should already disrupt
    the spectra with far too much noise

- brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, neutron stars and magnetrons


#### Skyrmion Misc...

  - [Gravitational Instanton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_instanton)
  - [Instanton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instanton)
    - i need to distinguish skyrmions and instantons (pseudoparticle?)

## Satellite misc

- (1/8/2017) assmue similarity in the variance in time delay & for GPS
  (locally & regionally) to augment other signals that predice
  atmospheric & weather conditions.
  - it's actually covered by this patent (2008):
    [All-weather precision guidance and navigation system ](https://www.google.ch/patents/EP1570289A2?cl=en)
  - this atmosphereically induced variation, augmented with DataSci/ML &
    other weather/atmospheric data signals can lead to improved
    resolution of device location by inferring regional rates of
    interference
    - also, this patent touches on the other half of the idea i was
      thinking about (2014):
      [GPS accuracy refinement using external sensors](https://www.google.com/patents/US9597014?dq=gps+accuracy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3vce6j4fXAhUELyYKHSNKBaYQ6AEILzAB)

## Improvements to Atomic/Quantum/Optical Clocks

- there have been major advances recently, current record-holder is
  [JILA](http://jilawww.colorado.edu/yelabs/research/ultracold-strontium),
  which traps ultracold gas of Strontium(Sr) atoms within a maser's
  optical fields
  - [2008 thesis on Strontium optical lattice clock](https://jila.colorado.edu/yelabs/sites/default/files/uploads/theses_2008_AndrewLudlow.pdf)

#### Perterbation of Optical Lattice (Sr) with Known Noise Signature

- injection of perterbation into optical lattice holding strontium
  atoms in place (they are held in energy wells...)
  - measure the the variance that emerges (or in the application of
    energy required to maintain stability)
    - since these are quantum effects, it may not be possible to just
      stir things up with some known noise
  - i'm not sure how they measure the vibration of Sr atoms in lattice
    - ultra-precise lasers of some harmonic frequency(?) of that
      absorbed/etc by strontium .... really out of my league here.
      - assumptions must be made on how the photons/light will be
        absorbed/refracted once the Sr is stabalized in the ideal
        lattice
  - however, wouldn't it be possible to perturb these particles,
    resulting in characteristic vibration of individual atoms inside
    the energy wells?
    - or, do the strontium atoms exit the optical lattice once their
      energy state changes? (i think so)
      - if i understood the thesis above & experiment design

#### Use Skymionic Mechanisms & Special Relativity For An Atomic Clock

- i already had this idea around late december 2016, first thing in
  the moleskin notebook
  - [JILA Atomic Clock on Dec 21st](https://phys.org/news/2016-12-jila-atomic-clock-mimics-long-sought.html)
    set a record for atomic clock accuracy by using skyrmionic effects
    with
  - can't find much anything else that matches "skyrmions" and "atomic
    clock" before this date. for this idea, if nothing else, it was (t
    < 6 months) for the time i thought about it and the time i see it
    first mentioned in research/journals/news
    - usually, there is at least 6+ month lag time b/w research, peer
      review, publish dates

#### (PostIt 1/8/2017) Injection of Known Noise Signatures into Lattice (w/ Isotopes, etc)

- optical clocks must have extremely high constraints
- use multiple isotopes, elements, crystal forms to improve the
  accuracy of atomic clocks via hyper/spectral processing & other
  methods
  - options for crystal lattice formulations
    - if you can guarantee the lattice has regularly-spaced inclusions
      of varying isotopes (very hard/expensive)
    - instead, assume/include random isotope variation, then
      measure/anticipate the actual variation
      - when you have random data/material for an experiment, but can
        measure its physical variance, this randomness *always* yields
        more flexible post/processing, pattern resolution from known
        noise signatures
