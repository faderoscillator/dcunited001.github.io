title: "the dark side of NLP"
---

- ok so, first things first: this shit is so bad, it's better if no
  one ever knew it could be possible. and i am talking about the
  psychological aspects of it. people might be better off without
  knowledge that this could even happen! however, if lack of
  knowledge/reaction to it means the shittiest people in society move
  up fastest, i just really don't give a fuck. some of this is
  paranoid, i guess. whatever. if you disqualify what i say here
  because it's paranoid, you don't understand that part of the intent
  is to drive paranoia and then fear.
  - fear is the true power of these psychological weapon
  - i started tweeting the CIA, mark warner and bob goodlatte about
    Covert NLP and immediately received more signal than i have ever
    had at one time. by like a factor of ten. like within 10 minutes
    from people who arrived at the coffee shop. *today: 9/28*, as i
    start writing this article.
    - yeh, it sounds crazy. ok that's fine. it wasn't "friendly" per
      se.... could very well be a coincidence, but it honestly didn't
      make a difference. no one can threaten me. i am sitting here
      writing with my back to the most vulnerable area: the door. i
      don't fear bluffs and obviously nothing like that can happen.
      - if i didn't fear it before, i don't fear anything like it
        now. apparently there's something really important happening.
        i don't know what it is, but this has happened before.
        - whatever is happening, information is leaking out of my
          personal life and experiences, but almost none of that
          information that seems to percolate back towards me ever
          supports my long-term goals: as i describe later, the whole
          point is to keep these targets in a state of perpetual
          financial/social isolation with no options so they are
          predictable and their behaviors are easily
          short-circuited. if the info is there, it only serves to
          affect my short-term decisions, to distract me from goals,
          to make me less efficient, to cause me to question people
          around me and to drive my paranoia, leading me to vocally
          discredit myself.
          - and if there is something going on with legal
            consequences, then stoking paranoia to get me to discredit
            myself is what is called *legally material* to someone
            else's argument, from what i have reasoned via int'l law
            - and ust common sense when realizing that if i told
              anyone things that never happened involving celebrities
              i never ment, then i would essentially be
              short-circuiting my own testimony or other facts in a
              defamation case. or something like it, which i never
              thought would happen, but hey! scientology, am i right?
              they have boatloads of lawyers. i should probably watch
              my ass and if someone gives me a digital trace or a
              phone call or indirect correspondence, the there's not
              much to worry about. that never happened. where the fuck
              was the beef? i did not want to predicate my actions on
              delusion.
      - i am going to keep writing about philosophy of math and
        linguistics and i am going to try to love life as much as i
        hope life could love someone. i am obsessed with linguistics
        and culture and knowledge and now philosophy, though my
        writing is only starting to improve.
      - so if you want to help, then cure my social isolation please,
        please help me with the persecution complex, but i'm pretty
        sure the torment needs to stop first.

- conditioning to design a nice user interface for your target
  - it's all about the buttons. what can you press to get them to set
    the off, provoke a reaction or shift their mind to focusing on
    something else -- like this draft?

- example of neurological hackery
  - stimulation of peripheral vision (which sounds dumb as !@#$)
    - this trick works on some psychological dispositions more than
      others.
      - say a group of people had access to plug someone into an fMRI
        while they were unaware, perhaps dosed with sedative hypnotics
        that leave some brain faculties functional while others become
        impaired or less likely to encode memory, then they could use
        VR simulation and generative AI techniques that can match
        voice/video of celebrities to imprint memories that never
        happened
        - or nvm, that's crazy as fuck. there is a strict maximum of
          0.0% risk of logistical problems for illegal/unexplainable
          medical procedures

- cover concept of configurational entropy, as it applies to physical
  tactics of social behavior
  - it is very difficult to discern these things and very easy to be
    wrong. however, there are characteristic features that i have seen
    emerge in what seems to be "Street Theatre" augmented with "Covert
    NLP"

  - physical arrangement of conversation:
    - the street theatre people usually arrive and need to find a
      situation where they can sit/stand/move near the target, while
      the target needs to focus
      - for me at least, other spatial arrangements and activies
        require development, **typology**, *training/documentation* of
        common activities of the target.
        - these have to be custom tailored to the target, possibly via
          advice of psychological consultants

  - psychological state: the target has been whittled down to nothing
    for months or years and they are in a stressful, vulnerable
    position
    - that is, psychologically, sociologically and financially
    - goals include:
      - undermine work/family relationships
      - undermine financial independence,
      - but most of all, encourage the development of complementary
        psychological complexes, exacerbation of mental illness and
        changes to psychological metaprogramming (like encouragement
        of magickal thinking and attempts to re/process statements
        with puns or hidden symbols, etc -- these may actually be
        included by a handler at first: it is part of Covert NLP =>
        it's fucking *covert*)

### Process Vulnerability Must Be Zero and So Must Legal Liability for Human Rights

- before i get to NLP, i want to talk about some new
  technologies. most of these are in their infancy, but not at DARPA.
  - however, it is incredibly important to clarify that the US
    government wants to avoid any physical contact like the plague
    because if your technique does not require implantation or
    constant checkup or strange UFO abductions... then your technique
    does not confer process vulnerability or much legal risk


# Up Front: why are these still War Crimes, according to Geneva?

the geneva convention defines psychological torture of enemy
combatants in *international armed conflicts* as being a
warcrime. however, probably because it's very hard to define, in any
case,


## Several Components

#### (1) The citizenship status of the target is unclear because they do not have legal rights available to ALL citizens

- this is a component of the argument that is incredibly complex
  because every country's legal systems are different.
  - international law is incredibly complicated.
    - new bodies can be created and there is no top down structure of
      authority where everything else fits neatly within it.
      - the UN partially fills this role, but each organization is its
        own.
      - each organization can overlap in authority or practice.
      - some organizations have courts in one city or in regions.
        this is mostly superficial -- however, most organization's
        courts just don't need their processes duplicated across
        regions for efficiency AFAIK.
        - this means it's complicated, each organization in its own
          way where the attorneys have to focus in narrow areas of
          international law.
      - the center of international law is in the Netherlands at the
        Hague, where the ICJ, the ICC and the ITLS are located
      - change occurs slow, but can also happen rapidly and, when
      - precedent can be unclear or non-existent
    - it does, it affects other int'l law systems
  - there is no top

#### (2) There is clear psychological torture and it's been affecting me since 2009, though that pales in comparison to constant engagement of shit today

- look around when this happens ... then again, i guess it's actually
  not that easy to see.

#### (3) Constriction of rights and financial resources means the targets do not realistically have the ability to leave the country without decla

- i do not have an ability to drive. since sept. 2014, i can't
  remember any time when i had more than $300 in my pocket.
  - this means i can't leave without applying for refugee status

#### (4) Applying for refugee status triggers specific protections, but you must qualify

- people don't apply for refugee status from the united states. it's
  unheard of. and who would help advise me on anything like this. no
  one will believe me
  - worse than being paranoid about intel agencies is being in a
    situation where it's true, esp if it's not a level playing field
    - i just never even considered that possibility (until 2011ish,
      but there i started studying about intelligence agencies just in
      case, so that i wouldn't become overly paranoid)

#### (5) if you legally cannot aid someone at all for whatever reason (which i think applies to NDAA non-enemy-combatants) then 

- i tried to talk to a lawyer, but if you're under surveillance and
  people can manipulate you psychologically and you have no resources,
  then what

- I *faxed* content to embassies in japan/canada in 2016 because
  - this was with a web service, so that the fax would travel across
    the internet and then hit the PTSN because i felt like i was being
    shadowbanned online at that time.
    - anything and everything i did had almost zero effect

    - in feb 2015, i recovered memories for which i was incredibly
      grateful, but doubt from nothing but circumstantial evidence,
      etc. quickly grew over the next few months.
      - in june 2015, from some notes i had written, i compiled an
        account of what happened to email it to my brother and sister
        (and possibly my mom and perry)
      - around the time trump declared his run for presidency and
        Mr. Robot came out, things got really dark.
      - strange anachronisms started showing up the more i thought
        about everything. and i never really swallowed it whole bc it
        was just so crazy and unlikely. it seemed to be catered just
        for my psychology and there were many elements which were
        legally material to the establishment of cognizance within the
        memories ... from the beginning.
        - 
      - people asked me about things related to this, but then "after
        i remembered" no one ever, ever, ever talked to me about it.
        - after i tried to tell my brother about some elements of it
          at the beach in june 2015, i have never had more than a five
          minute conversation with anyone about it. i'm not sure that
          i discussed it with my family for more than five minutes
          there, which is partially why i wanted to compile the notes
          into an email to send it to them because it was just too
          fantastical.

### the general strategy centers around minimization of legal liability and protracted constriction of the target's financial/social resources

- No Physical Contact? Constantly Shift Street Theatre Actors? No
  Vulnerability, No Liability

  - cases of organizaed psychological harassment are incredibly
    difficult to win or argue as long as the participants do not
    digitize information and always use pattern languages and covers.
    - that's all you need: the same techniques spies have used to
      communicate for centuries, as well as some imagination &
      knowledge of NLP
    - best of all, you get the target comfortable with a new "handler"
      and then encourage the target to change their metaprogramming to
      read way to much into subtle cues and images.
      - and at this point, it develops a life of its own. leave no
        digital trace, *and there is no case*. if you have filtered
        your targets to pick on the vulnerable and the poor and the
        weak and those eager to have someone that might reach out...
        - then that draws the target in because you have already
          ensured they have zero financial/social capital. they have
          no money for a long time. they have had very few social
          connections/interactions for a long time.
        - of course when someone acts like a friend, appeals to the
          targets specific interests
          - and further seems to have information that will be
            gradually titrated out to the target
          - then, of course, the target responds positively!
        - now you have compliance, which means the target willingly
          ingests your signal or the information the HUMINT feeds
          them.
          - but it's strange bc, at no point will the HUMINT actually
            aid the target in pursuit of long-term goals
            - OR the development of significant financial or social
              capital that might give the target options.
            - #### more options == less predictable
            - #### more money == more options (potentially moving)
            - #### more movement around US == greater spread of digitized
              information among the organization perpetrating this
              - you don't want the target to move, it means you have
                to summarize everything you did and move it towards
                the next city.
              - so if this is true, you won't want them to move or get
                a new job somewhere else. why? because you have
                already pinned them down
            - #### more social interactions == more signal from more people
              - the target receives a wider variety of information
                from a wider variety of sources
              - if this is the case, they may forget about the
                gaslighting bullshit "GAMES" you are applying to them.
                - oh yeh, these assholes are going to need new pattern
                  languages and guess what: update mechanisms for
                  chaotic programs are some of the most expensive
                  parts of them.
              - you don't want the target to become distracted. or
                worse: to lose that valuable long-term psychological
                state you worked so hard to create!
                - what i don't understand is how these process
                  requirements are conveyed to people without speaking
                  in the clear
                  - they need education in psychology. they need a lot
                    of understanding. or they would need to review
                    video/audio of targets like there's a week left
                    until the biggest game of the year (but every
                    week)
                  - and holy shit. surveillance? used for
                    psychological warfare? conducted against our own
                    citizens?
            - #### more social connections == more options
              - the main HUMINT "handler" and the target must not
                always have positive interactions
              - usually there are several stratifications of authority
                and higher up HUMINT resources or officers will be
                incredibly intelligent (perhaps attorneys, like one of
                ...)
                - but those people *most* cognizant will know to fear
                  getting their hands dirty.
              - the higher ups will always want to play the good cop
                and other HUMINT resources will want to switch off on
                pressure.
              - this constant juxtaposition creates tension &
                confusion in the target, but it's all artificial.
                - they are pinging from one victimizer to another in
                  their small, small social environment.
              - so if you are micromanaging this *literal* social
                prison, you absolutely do not want the target to get
                away. so you will push others away who get close to
                him/her.

### Covert NLP

- *covert* NLP almost certainly requires the early development of
  compliance.
  - this is critical, but even if the target becomes less eager,
    uncompliant

# New Neurological Methodologies

- TMS and TCCD are fairly new. they open up a ton of roads for
  neurological research.

## TMS - [Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation)

- TMS can be used to target neural circuits to encourage them to fire
  faster. small groups of neurons can have their expression
  upregulated (in the *CHAOS PROGRAM* of *human cognition*)
  - generally, what you need to know is that the neurons that fire
    more:
    1. receive more blood flow
    2. receive more nutrients
    3. transform & alter expression of surrounding networks more
- 

669-221-6251

## TCD/TCCD
[Transcranial Doppler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_Doppler)

- i *fear* this second method absolutely is being used, may enable
  remote triggering of ... fuck i have no idea lmao
  - but if you implant several nearly microscopic devices in/around
    the skull, this alone can be used to slowly drive someone crazy.
    - there is no EMF footprint, unlike that of TMS, though some
      theoretically miniscule device implanted in the temple or
      strategically located to reverberate through the brain's
      cardiovascular system...
    - like they just start inexplicably hearing ~4000hz for 15-60
      minutes, but only ever at home and usually when they are going
      to bed.
    - that shit would drive me crazy. not really though. 4000hz is not
      so easy to hear.
- obviously, there has been a bit of digression and now wherefore
  regression into thence passive tense. uh oh. holy shit CRAZY
  TOWN. it's a movie playing in theaters soon, starring you because
  DARPA has been studying TMS/TCCD like crazy.
  - don't believe any of this directed energy shit, by the way, but if
    it is real, the tin foil and the faraday cage won't help you.

- TCCD is more powerful than TMS.

        or other analogous techniques like, especially when in the context
        of ultrasound 


### Being "Range Bound"

A **target** who is **range-bound** then becomes exponentially more
predictable. In this case, they will attempt to prevent you from
moving at all costs. You are already compromised. You cannot afford a
lawyer. You can barely keep your head above water and everyone around
you is likely "in" on it, though friends and family will have
psychologically compartmentalized and will not admit it. They will
seek to prevent you from moving at all costs: you cannot get a job in
a remote city: they will interfere at any cost: tampering with email;
rerouting planes & delaying flights; influencing who interviews or
phone screens you. What's the first paperwork you file at a new job:
the I-9. These people have a network they can leverage that ideally
extends to any/all places of non-contractual employment. It expands
the number of places where information (if any) is recorded. If
someone made egregious mistakes in your case, they might now have to
attone for it.

A target who is _range-bound_ in this way then becomes exponentially
more predictable. In this case, a target's sociophysical motion will
be restricted at all costs -- especially major physical
relocations. Here, sociophysical motion does not refer to motion in
physical spaces, but to all motion of energy across any sociophysical
topologies. By pragmatically restricting this motion, it renders you
more predictable, subjugated, fearful and pathetic in all ways. You
are prey that has been cornered. Run to Switzerland. Do not run to an
enemy nation unless you are an enemy. You will certainly not be safe
there.

Why go through all the trouble to prevent you from moving? This forces
transfer of information across logistic structures, which expands
surface area for risk and liability and requires time/energy to
artifice new relationships to control the target.
