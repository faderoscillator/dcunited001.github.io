In societies with different governmental structures, what motivates
people to work hard? In communist societies and democratic,
free-market societies, how does this differ? This question is of
utmost importance: to defend any specific system and to understand
society itself. In a free-market, democratic system, it is a mix of
financial and sociocultural incentivization that pushes people to
achieve more, for themselves and for society.

# [Social and Financial Connections Form Circuits Of Influence](#social-and-financial-connections-form-circuits-of-influence)

In a communist system, the incentivization is primarily sociocultural,
achieved through social engineering, which exists to a lesser extent
which the Party creates values systems that are designed to push
people towards striving for some collective end. These systems created
by social engineering are far from perfect, vulnerable to subversion
and usually idealized by academics blinded by their own righteousness.
When all you have is a hammer, everthing looks like a nail. Social
engineers believe that through academic ideas, they have all the
answers, but are often blind to the truly limited scope of their
knowledge.

We need a revolution, not just in America, but across the world. There
isn't a better time for it than now. However, revolutions can be
violent or involve large transfers of assets. We don't need any of
that. War is expensive, in terms of human and financial capital. For
assets in our economy, both the subversive transition of control and
the forcible transfer of ownership take a toll on productivity and
economic resilience. They are morally wrong, and a major drain on the
economy at a time when we need America to be as competitive as
possible.

# [Our Revolution of Empowerment](#our-revolution-of-empowerment)

Imagine a revolution of empowerment. It starts with the individual, so
that we can transform the world from the ground up. This builds on the
ideas in this series: engineering the creation and diffusion of
influence in a society, but approaching this in a simple, common-sense
manner. With all the knowledge in the world, we delude ourselves into
forcing artificial changes, but when we grasp onto things tightly, we
always get it wrong and what we're left with isn't what we wanted at
all. Instead we should ensure that societal ills become more visible,
metrics are analyzed to ensure our tactics actually improve conditions
of poverty, and the solutions we implement naturally and actually
produce positive changes.

### [Why Wait For Someone To Get In Power When Change Emerges from the Individual?](#why-wait-for-someone-to-get-in-power-when-change-emerges-from-the-individual)

This doesn't start with waiting for someone to get in power. Our
revolution transcends identity and we can instead empower ourselves.
It doesn't start with the perfect ism or the perfect social
institutions operating with the perfect doctrine and the perfect set
of people. Instead, our movement assumes that nothing is or can become
perfect and entails constant self-realization, not just of the
individual, but of strata of society. It starts with the individual,
who once empowered and relieved of restraint, can transform the world
around themselves.

This self-realization requires education. Never in human history have
we had more tools at their fingertips for our collective
self-empowerment than we do now. Today, every person is empowered to
learn at minimal cost with minimal investment. Knowledge is power &
let's harness that. To manifest this and accelerate our
transformation, we'll need to utilize a bit of social engineering.

![Populous](/img/posts/revolution-of-empowerment/populous.jpg)

The origin to success is leveraging the social and financial graphs
for profit. The key to conflict is the ability to induce, control or
withstand change in the social and financial graphs. This applies to
success and conflict in economic, sociocultural, politcal and military
fields. At no time in mankind's history have we experienced more
structural change to our shared social, financial and informational
graphs.

<a name="a-paradox-of-aristocracy" />

### [A Paradox of Aristocracy](#a-paradox-of-aristocracy)

In Republic, Plato covers intergenerational dynamics that lead to a
corrosion of values that foment prosperity. This is an interesting
paradox, that the conditions which create prosperity eventually wane
because of it. It seems to be that those who are born into an era of
prosperity are less likely to understand the work ethic that leads to
sustainence of wealth. They are inherently less capable of sustaining
the hard work that leads to it because they themselves did not suffer
and travail to achieve it.

This is a problem that social engineering can help address. Social
institutions can program our youth to short-circuit this paradox.
Far-left movements such as socialism and communism critique the social
institution of religion, which was society's answer to this paradox in
the past. These movements are inherently incapable of delivering what
they promise because they dismantle the institutions that provide the
social programming that counters the ironic corrosion of virtues that
accompany prosperity. Socialism is only capable of providing services
when there is prosperity because these services depend on taxes which
evaporate without a competitive economy. Therefore, as socialism and
communism are typically packaged, they are doomed to fail. This is the
precise progression that Plato acknowledges in the Republic.

<a name="a-paradox-of-modernity" />

### [A Paradox of Modernity](#a-paradox-of-modernity)

There is a paradox of social circumstances that accompanies
modernity. It is exacerbated by novel channels of communication and
economic circumstance. As we develop more technology, especially the
capacity to educate people faster, we should see a dramatic shift in
the quality of life that lifts everyone up. This is true: technology
means the ability to provide higher quality of life is cheaper. In
developed nations, metrics for quality of life are higher than ever,
but leftists are louder than ever.

This is partly because of the ability for people to have their message
heard on communication platforms such as social media, but also
because of the exigent economic dependencies, the fulfillment of which
allowed modernization and technology to foment in the first place.
Coupled with overpopulation, these economic dependencies become more
and more difficult to maintain.

The the paradox is clear: today, people are pushed to the left in
response to poverty, but never in human history have we had more tools
at our fingertips for self-empowerment. How is this possible? Why
would people feel less empowered or in more vulnerable economic
position. People face a myriad of financial challenges, of course.
However, it should be apparent: people today are paradoxically weaker
versions of themselves because of their dependency on technology and
because of our lack of cultural propagation mechanisms. That's not the
answer a politician would give you, but there it is.

<a name="utopias-fountainhead" />

### [Utopia's Fountainhead](#utopias-fountainhead)

We must to upgrade our sociocultural operating system. This isn't
saying we need a single religion to unite us. However, the
underpinnings we use to architect our individual worldviews must to
adapt in response to technology and the resulting sociocultural
shifts. Otherwise, this corrosion of character will continue and our
society will be unable to sustain itself.

It would seem that without the appropriate means of understanding
life, that utopia itself is a paradox, doomed to gradual erosion. What
powers our pseudo-utopia and why? This is an insight lost to most
Americans today. They simply do not understand what generates the
fertile soil of prosperity that we share. People today are
fickle. They do not have values and they are easily led to what seem
to be greener pastures without understanding what they have now.

The answer to our problems is not some ism. The answer is to look
inwards and to be honest with ourselves. We need to remain capable of
transforming ourselves, in spite of an environment that tells us we
don't need change and in spite of a media that tells us our problems
are our leaders. In today's environment, prevailing attitudes make
this very difficult, especially in void of sociocultural institutions
designed to provide a constant measure. Religions are a traditional
means of providing this unwavering measure to society. Today's liberal
attitudes enable anyone to decouple from the evolutionary sieving
mechanisms that filtered strong men and women in the past. It's very
easy to survive without adapting yourself to any ideals. As we zoom
out from individuals to the level of society, this void makes us all
weaker. It doesn't really matter what belief system we adhere to that
provides us with impossible ideals to measure up to, but we need one
or we are lost.

###

By architecting the proper social institutions and laying the
groundwork for changes leading to an ideal social graph, humanity
ensures that, through the sum of individual actions, a gradual
dispersion of social and financial capital ameliorates issues such as
poverty and lack of control over one's circumstances. Ideally, we
shall maximize human potential, understanding and virtue. Given social
and financial graphs that are (ideal), the individual should be able
to lift themselves up.

That is, problems in society like poverty stem ultimately from the
social graph. They cannot be resolved by forcibly taking wealth from
one group and giving it to another. These problems can only be
resolved by architecting changes in the social and financial graphs
that enable proper dispersion of social and financial influence. Given
that and free of encumbrances, the individual and groups in society
should be able to (lift themselves out of these problems.)

This has always been true, but until now, it has been difficult to
measure the social graph to any degree of confidence. But today, we
should be able to leverage technology to identify the true source of
problems, which are in the structure of the social and financial
graph. From these insights, we can make meaningful changes that enable
the individual to solve their own problems.

<a name="social-and-financial-connections-are-circuits-of-influence" />

# [Social and Financial Connections Form Circuits Of Influence](#social-and-financial-connections-form-circuits-of-influence)

Power and the circuits by which influence is transferred in society
operate in completely different manners in various governmental
systems. These circuits are like channels over which social and
financial capital can flow. There are various types of channels and
types of influence, the accumulation of which is either social or
financial capital.

These circuits of influence can be wisely or poorly architected,
forming systems of incentivization and motivation for citizenry.
Hence, they can be designed as sociocultural underpinnings to evoke
specific virtues, ideals and behaviors within people. Within different
political and cultural environments, these channels are structured and
arranged to behave in various ways and can be blocked or unavailable,
resulting in less than desirable social mobility.

### [Communism Restricts Social Mobility and Undermines Prosperity]()

Communism minimizes wealth as a store of social influence by design.
To the detriment of America, most socialists and marxists do not
*truly* understand this or its consequences. They make a bargain to
improve their situation and harness demagoguery to get what they want
in the short-term. They do that without understanding how it cripples
evolutionary mechanisms for aspects of society, reducing the rate of
meaningful change and the degrees of freedom in society. It powers its
services with central banking that inevitably fails, while undermining
fundamental factors that lead to prosperity.

Socialists seek to ameliorate stress they experience without actually
understanding or caring to address the root causes. This instead
covers up symptoms, exacerbating the problems later on, leveraging an
illusion of wealth powered by Keynesian economics and cheap credit.

In this way, socialists barter their children's future for their own
illusion of prosperity and are left with debt without resolving the
true causes of their problems. It takes generations to realize the
folly of this domestic economic policy and by the time people wake up,
it's too late: the only answer is more of the same. In the end, a
nation's citizens are less equiped to deal with threats foreign and
domestic.

<a name="communism-is-less-equiped-to-incentivize-behavior" />

### [Communism is Less Equiped to Incentivize Behavior](#communism-is-less-equiped-to-incentivize-behavior)

Communism, lacking financial channels for incentivization is thus,
less equipped for motivating citizenry. Because its mechanics and
implementation force the supression of competing means of social
influence (i.e. suppression of religion) it yields a populus less
capable of fending for itself out of a void of intergenerational
experience. For communism, the lack of financially incentivized
behavior magnifies the already burdensom costs of expensive social
programs. It's full of wishful thinking: that people can be motivated
through patriotism and Party loyalty alone, especially when those
ideals are suspect and citizens understand they are swimming in a
toxic ideology which breeds sociopathic behavior and blindly chases
utilitarian, materialistic ideals.

### [Turn Inwards And Conquer Inner Space](#turn-inwards-and-conquer-inner-space)

Instead of adopting the ideals of some 'ism or blaming our problems on
something external, we will turn inwards for our revolution. We will
conquer inner space, starting from the individual, rather than to seek
solutions outside. We need to conquer the negativity in our hearts
that leads to problems in the world. Everything good and everything
evil arises from our hearts and minds. Emotions, thoughts, words,
actions, rigid beliefs. It comes from our hearts first.

If we survive the next 100 years, we'll survive for 10,000 years.
Humanity has enough problems given our current circumstances and
possibility of catastrophe in the near future. Why should we permit
conflict to burden us more?! If we need the best aspects of the human
condition to inspire us through this next century, should we continue
to sow the worst seeds of human behavior, fallible at best and
malevolent when unchecked?

<a name="liquidity-and-flux-of-influence-in-society" />

# [Liquidity and Flux of Influence In Societies](#liquidity-and-flux-of-influence-in-societies)

A political ideology's framework or a society's platform for
incentivization should be paramount in any evaluation of that
collection of institutions capacity to serve the people. Its ability
to compel morality, strong character, beneficence and a resilient
culture are crucial metrics in deciding whether change is needed. The
framework or platform must serve the people in the short term and the
long term. If it doesn't compel and incentivize beneficent development
of the people as strong, vigilant and capable of handling any
situation, it leaves them vulnerable in the long term.

The adoption of philosophy into the application of governance involves
evolutionary dynamics, where the energy expended results in the net
accumulation of value shared by groups and society at
large. Therefore, systems that do not, in practice, produce and
sustain motivation are vulnerable to accession by more suited
frameworks of governance.

<a name="the-micro-and-macro-of-influence-dispersion" />

### [The Micro and Macro of Influence Dispersion](#the-micro-and-macro-of-influence-dispersion)

Individuals and groups can harness influence creation and diffusion
empower themselves. How individuals can generate social and financial
influence? How do groups of various sizes aggregate and manage
influence? How do families, small groups and communities connect to
transfer and manage influence?

- how else does influence flow in the micro scale?
  - what do we use it on? we need things (favors, jobs, etc) from
    each other on a small scale.
    - this can be explained in a kind of anarcho-capitalist way
    - voting with your dollar
  - typically anyone who's building their life upwards is gaining
      influence and power over their circumstances
    - but there are people who squander their money/etc through poor
      decisions or destructive lifestyles
    - and those who lose their money/influence because of conditions
      outside of their control

Education can be used to strengthen or weaken those influence creation
mechanisms and so is an incredibly important vehicle for affecting
change.

People can influence others in many ways: via direct communication,
media, creation of ideas, commerce, law, etc. However, the capacity
for these transactions of influence to take place emerges from the
structure of the social graph. The more connected people are the more
advantaged in this situation. So the size of an individual's 2&#x00B0;
and 3&#x00B0; neighborhoods in the social graph, their capacity to
leverage that set of nodes and those nodes' level of influence
themselves form the basis of valuable metrics of social and financial
affluence. If we measure this today, we will find that there are many
people like myself who are socially and financially disempowered. This
can intentionally methodically leveraged as a method of
control. People who are disconnected from the social graph with little
social or financial capital are especially vulnerable.

#### In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream

![In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream]()

- the structures by which a society enables/controls the diffusion of
  influence lay the foundation for incentivization in society
  - this idea breaks down a bit in the face of a generally demoralized
    society that doesn't identify opportunities or completely lacks
    true opportunity for self-empowerment
  - these mechanisms of incentivizations include:
    - desire for a specific role
    - desire for power in hierarchy or local power/influence
    - desire to accumulate wealth
    - religion
    - education & culture
    - assets (both systems transfer influence via assets)
    - patriotism
      - this includes goals and dreams like those sold to us in
        advertising and via culture

### The Mechanics of the Social Graph's Space

- this social graph lays a foundation for an extremely
  high-dimensional space
- local/global phase transitions and eigenstates in a social or
  financial graph.
  - this results in hyperdymensional emergent phenomena
    - including social ills and mental illness
- phase transitions and other emergent phenomena are coupled to the
  sparseness of the graph data.
  - for this and other reasons, the nature of the system is completely
    different in a hyperconnected world.
    - in a sparse social graph, emergent phenomena are shorter lived
      and less likely to affect large regions of the graph
    - in a hyperconnected social graph, higher order phenomena are
      more likely to emerge, will exhibit greater effect on larger

- in sparse social graphs, the number of connections to each person is
  closer to
  [dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number)
  - this rule of 150 connections still applies in the hyperconnected
    world, but is moreso related to the number of high-quality
    relationships that a person has the mental energy, cognitive
    capacity and time to cultivate.
  - the social graph can be visualized with a spatial component, where
    connections have a physical distance associated with them that
    affects how the nodes interact. in today's hyperconnected social
    graph, the connections that form do so over much greater distances
    and therefore, the constraints associated with time and space
    gradually disintegrate.
    - in the social graph of centuries past, these spatial constraints
      on information exchange would limit the speed at which ideas
      travel, but today are non-existant.
    - constraints on information spread are now much more logical
      instead of physical.

- in a social graph sparsely connected via lack of technology, this
  forces people to build rigidly maintained social hierarchies to
  offset the informational disadvantages of a sparsely connected
  social graph. in the past, people were forced to be incredibly
  creative in building these stratifying hierarchies in order to
  remain apprised of relevant information.
  - this paradigm is upset and even inverted in a hyperconnected
    world. the challenge is no longer overcoming the limitations of
    time and space in order to filter important and relevant
    information up the hierarchy. instead, in addition to dealing with
    the quantity of social media data streaming from all over the
    world, the challenge is to overcome the structural changes that
    obliterate these rigidly maintained hierarchies.
    - the phenomena of hierarchical structures arising in the social
      graph representing society is no longer required for the system
      to filtrate information and to inform itself of critical events.
      - is there another way to word this? examples?
      - hierarchical structures still emerge within the system, but
        they are more likely to be interconnected, whereas before
        instantaneous communication, those that emerged more much more
        centralized and singular
- (the main point here is that a hyperconnected system forms
  connections & hierarchies in fundamentally different ways and for
  different reasons)

# (Form of the Social and Financial Graphs)

<a name="the-financial-graph-inherits-the-form-of-the-social-graph" />

- leveraging financial aid and foreign direct investment as a means of
  establishing a platform for potential projection of soft power
  - this catalyses the development of options/opportunities that may
    remain mostly unused until they are needed.
  - furthermore, (to cultivate their viability), these options should be
    regularly exercised (more here)
- from a social graph perspective, this effect can be
  optimized for flexibility and expediency of action in the future by
  quantifying the dynamics in social graph changes over time
  - the analysis of social graph data science can be used as a source
    of intelligence to inform actions, expand flexibility of options
    and maximize utility of those options
- therefore ... () ... expands efficiency, expediency, etc.

### [The Financial Graph Inherits the Form of the Social Graph](#the-financial-graph-inherits-the-form-of-the-social-graph)

To understand how social and financial influence spreads through a
society, we'll need to be familiar with the structure of the graph
over which people form connections. The financial graph emerges from
the social graph, but also compels form to emerge in the social
graph. There is dualistic interplay determining the base structure in
both the social and financial graphs. This cyclic interplay resulting
in emergent form weaves additional channels for influence dispersion
from sources of financial capital into social capital and vice versa,
which better serves people who have little of either than a
party-defined, purely social graph. So, the benefits of free market
capitalism include variation in the structure of the social graph that
thus encourages dispersion of capital over channels that wouldn't
exist in a command driven, communist economy.

That's one reason communism is its own antithesis: it is an ideology
that mathematically leaves people less equipped for upwards mobility
in society. Also, both communism's social and financial graph
structures converge towards party ideals. Because the social graph
itself is dependent on party ideals, this leaves the people less
socially free in addition to being economically restricted by low
savings rates and unpredictable macroeconomic conditions.

<a name=in-the-free-market-entities-coalesce-around-efficient-and-value-creating-solutions" />

### [In the Free Market, Entities Coalesce Around Efficient And Value-Creating Solutions](#in-the-free-market-entities-coalesce-around-efficient-and-value-creating-solutions)

In democracy and free market systems, social networks are free to form
around issues in society, and end up more pragmatically shaped around
the solutions to them. This general phenomenon, the tendancy of the
social graph to be formed in line with ideals, varies along a
continuum stretches from democracy, socialism, communism and
authoritariansm. In authoritarian and communist systems, the social
graph mirrors some ideals that are forced on people. Socialism adopts
less government mediated structure and graph influence than communism,
but more than free-market systems. Once the social graph and
especially the financial graph incur significant changes, this is
incredibly hard to undo.

The other side to this continuum along the level of the government
influence in and on the social graph, the extremes of which would
include anarchism. However, almost any government interference affects
the quality of economic/financial signal coming from
markets. Additional influence on the social graph and its behavior
will further tend to mask true trends in price, value and
demand. Particularly interesting is the effect of belief of
participants in shifting the social fabric.

<a name="trends-that-strongly-mutate-the-social-graph-can-last-for-generations" />

### [Trends That Strongly Mutate the Social Graph Can Last For Generations](#trends-that-strongly-mutate-the-social-graph-can-last-for-generations)

During traditional revolution, because of transfer of assets,
disruption and coercive dynamics, the flow, channels and gradient of
influence become disrupted. This confluence always trends against the
status quo. Once new structures congeal in the social and financial
graphs, they become difficult to reset without unprecendented dynamics
and nearly impossible to restore. The Party that seizes power will
surreptitiously employ tactics to disempower opponents and stifle
reactionary sentiment. They always do so before achieving nominal
power because the seeds of such political transformations require
generations.

That's not to say that free market capitalism is perfect,
but social metrics should give us better insight on how to make the
economy work for the common person again. To start, we can use data
science to optimize people's accessibility to interacitons with nodes
on the social graph.

<a name="the-sociocultural-implementation-of-mathematical-optimization" />

### [The Sociocultural Implementation of Mathematical Optimization](#the-sociocultural-implementation-of-mathematical-optimization)

- mention the invisible hand

Free-market capitalist practices are basically the sociocultural
implementation of mathematical optimization of price, value,
geographic dispersion of resources and other factors. Free market
economics provide more efficient groupings of resources and people
that enables more accurate optimization, a result of competition.
Machine learning algorithms are essentially competition between
various groupings of analytical solutions to a problem. Each economic
entity's product is like it's version of a solution for demand which
competes against other products and processes to optimize price.

These capitalist practices can be abused, which also disrupts the
capacity of the social graph for dispersion of wealth and
influence. However, they are useful as a natural tool for optimizing
the economics of a small or large region because they will always
yield better information than the politburo. Both the politburo and
the free market have the capacity to be abused, but eliminating the
use of the market in pricing goods results in economic harm. More
power finds itself in the hands of fewer people.

<a name="the-graphs-of-command-economies-are-inherently-more-vulnerable" />

### [The Graphs of Command Economies Are Inherently More Vulnerable](#the-graphs-of-command-economies-are-inherently-more-vulnerable)

Aspects of command economies make them inherently supsect,
economically. The graph structure is less robust and less tested
against real economic problems. This later aspect is further
exacerbated since command economies depend on external stimulation to
succeed and the global market is [mostly] a free market. Thus, it
cannot be so predicted. The tightly structured economic graph with
fewer nodes mitigites meaningful signal from the economy and its own
markets are thus inherently less capable of pricing goods
accurately. Metrics for anticipation of global economic trends are
themselves less robust and so are a vulnerability in the case of
economic warfare. Because of their susceptibility to global economics
and because their internal economics are not-optimally valued, then
pure command economies and restricted or poorly structured markets
fail.

Today in the age of economic and information warfare, the economic
aspects of policy and governance are paramount. Information warfare
tactics are great counters to economic warfare, because they disrupt
belief, prices and expectations.

<a name="free-market-systems-are-lean-with-flexible-evolutionary-dynamics" />

### [Free Market Systems Are Lean With Flexible Evolutionary Dynamics](#free-market-systems-are-lean-with-flexible-evolutionary-dynamics)

Because the graphs of free-market systems have forms dependent on
pragmatism and are motivated by winning through market competion, this
augments your system's ability to quickly adapt to shifts, both
microeconomic and macroeconomic. This is because entities acting
across the financial graph are free to reshape them as necessity and
trends dictate. They are not limited in form by tight coupling to
ideology. Therefore, businesses, consumers and etc are free to reshape
themselves as they need, resulting in type-speciation of roles and
behaviors in each businesses and consumers. This type-speciation is
what tends towards quick and dynamic evolution to capture global
economic demand early.

<a name="when-hyper-connected-the-metaphysical-becomes-increasingly-relevant" />

### [When Hyper-Connected, the Metaphysical Becomes Increasingly Relevant](#when-hyper-connected-the-metaphysical-becomes-increasingly-relevant)

Technology and hyper-connectedness trend towards accelerating
manisfestation of the metaphysical in the physical world. Therefore,
our world is more likely to become shaped by beliefs, belief systems
and epimemetic systems faster because of its hyperconnected nature and
the exponential rates of information transfer, accumulation and
dispersion. Hyperconnectedness also impacts the visibility of certain
timeless truths that seem to disappear or become masked by louder
phenomena and seem to disappear into adumbration, but are more
relevant than ever. In this way, people become in some ways less
capable of navigating aspects of social networks than before.

How can we recognize this accelerated manifestation of the
metaphysical and harness it for our betterment instead of our
detriment? What options are there for architecting the teleology of
phenomena and experience in the 21st century?

<a name="inherently-predispositioned-to-developing-weak-economic-fundamentals" />

### [Inherently Predispositioned to Developing Weak Economic Fundamentals](#inherently-predispositioned-to-developing-weak-economic-fundamentals)

Socialism and particularly communism lead to dramatic shifts in the
social and financial graphs that undermine the fundamentals of
prosperity. This flaw to shift towards a fundamentally weaker system
is inherent in the ideology. Therefore, those who adapt to this are
hurting American economic interests at the most critical time of
innovation in history. These weaker system also accumulates wasted
economic output over time. Many of this ideas are difficult to
understand or completely missed without a perspective augmented by
graph theory.

# [Contrasting Systems of Incentivization and Influence Dispersion](#contrasting-systems-of-incentivization-and-influence-dispersion)

The financial equivalents of social influence, currency and wealth are
really a medium of exchange for what conveys liquidity of influence.
And so, ultimately, the question comes down to how does each system of
governance and each society structure its mechanisms for diffusion of
influence, both social and finacial, and how do those systems of
influence dispersion interact?

### [Influence Behaves Very Differently In Various Societies](#influence-behaves-very-differently-in-various-societies)

For a particular society or type of government, how does one acquire,
dispense, or accumulate influence? This ends up being very different
in each kind of system, but it's easier to accumulate influence in

conferring a store of generalized influence.

### [Low Savings Rates Strongly Constrain Diffusion of Influence to the People](low-savings-rates-strongly-constrain-diffusion-of-influence-to-the-people)

In communist command economies, it's difficult for one to accumulate
wealth because taxes are very high, tending towards very low private
savings rates. Expenses are then a higher proportion of the average
person's wages than in capitalist systems that preserve the middle
class. If wealth drives influence in capitalist systems, then
restriction of wealth to a small segment of communist society means
that region's citizens likely have less influence over their
circumstances. This leads... (to wot?)

### [The Use of Social Engineering in Command Economies Constraints Influence to Ideals](#the-use-of-social-engineering-in-command-economies-constrains-influence-to-ideals)

Diffusion of influence is more tightly constrained in communist or
socialist societies by design. This is required for social engineering
to affect behavior. The people can only influence their local
cirumstances through social means and because influence diffusion is
restricted to rigid hierachies, the people's only means of
accumulating power is itself also more restricted. Further, under
party dominance, communication over any channel is more heavily
restricted. It's the norm instead of the exception, especially higher
up the hierarchy where people are entrusted with power. If you don't
conform, then the system strongly prefers you to be disempowered, if
not for the system's self-preservation then at least for advancement
of its goals.

<a name="constraints-to-influence-diffusion-are-further-constrained-by-groupthink" />

### [Constraints to Influence Diffusion are Further Contrained by Groupthink](#constraints-to-influence-diffusion-are-further-constrained-by-groupthink)

These factors increase societal friction and reduce social mobility
for private individuals to confer influence. By design, this tight
constraint on influence diffusion keeps people in line, magnified by
the groupthink results from tightly controlled social hierarchies. The
groupthink and us-versus-everyone-else mentality tends towards pushing
out minority opinions and ethnic groups, instead of including them.
They are instead used as a tool to further the agenda of the movement,
but because communism always results in strong, central authority,
social and ethnic minority groups suffer in the end.

### [Constraint of Belief Systems Leading to Monopolization of Thought and Behavior](#constraint-of-belief-systems-leading-to-monopolization-of-thought-and-behavior)

- describe the aims behind elimination of religion is moreso
  a monopolization of belief systems that strips people and communities
  of freedom to belief.
  - in this way, a communist Party is essentially setting itself up as
    God by abusing cult of personality, even at the same time as
    selling itself as atheist and impartial.

###

- if influence exchanges (via wealth, role, or otherwise) could
  be mapped out in a graph for democratic and communist systems
  - for both, are the nodes in the graph would be defined by the
    hierarchical organizations of business, government, party and
    family/social institutions
    - the ways in which influence is exchanged in communist countries
      more closely aligns with the hierarchical structures of nodes in
      the social graph.
      - influence is more likely to be exchanged with local nodes
        in the hierarchy
        - there would less edges connecting nodes across hierarchies
          for organizations and especially moving upwards in society.
      - this means it's harder for someone to work their way up in a
          country like this.
        - obviously one of the main ideas of communism is to
          empower the poor and the hardest working..
        - *but i'd love to talk with someone who's studied this
          precise topic in political theory: how easy is it to
          move upwards in society and how does that differ in
          implementations of these two systems*

- in democratic countries, because people are more free to design
  their own hierarchical structures, intermix b/w them, communicate
  freely, etc
  - then upward motion in society here is very much dependent on
    starting conditions, especially with regard to education and
    wealth
    - but again, this system also has mechanisms in place to
      ensure that we have opportunities for all
      - or it should, at least
      - the graph here would edges allowing influence to diffuse
        more freely across society,
        - however, because some groups accumulate significantly
          more wealth than others, this allows people to exert
          more control on the system as a whole
          - but IMO property rights are crucial. if your system
            doesn't protect property rights, it's not for me. it
            might work in other places....
            - i want to be motivated by what i can attain and i
              want others to have the same. however, i'm motivated
              by what i can attain to use for others' benefit.
              that is, ultimately. as of now, i don't have
              resources


### (Property Rights)

- communism often lacks true property rights and thus, it can be hard
  to truly own something and control it completely or sell it
  - further, if you are permitted to sell real-estate and other assets
    on their more controlled market, then, since the gov't controls
    exchange of most assets on the market, they really have the
    advantage to determine market behavior.
    - also, with much lower savings rates, it becomes harder to find
      buyers for large assets. again, fewer merchants on the market
      means a market favors the government every time, or any group
      exchanging with significant investment in those assets

  - regardless of whether you have true property rights and the
    ability to sell in a disadvantageous market,
    - someone still needs to control who uses those asset resources
      and how. individuals associated with owners or government
      institutions decide how people use property of the state (and
      property "owned" by individuals)
    - therefore property is moreso controlled rather than owned.
      - zooming out to a wider scope, this leaves individuals
        disempowered and unable to deviate from state policy.

### Incentivization Structures in Authoritarian Government Exchange Free Financial Mechanisms for Affluence with Government Institutions

- (but the point is:) the main incentivization structures for communism
  and democracy basically just exchanges $$$ for affluence with
  government institutions.
  - it's really one for another. both systems require the diffusion of
    influence through currency and social institutions.
    - communism and socialism with controlled economies depend more on
      leveraging institutions than cash
    - democracy with capitalsm depend more on wealth to act as a store
      of value, but really as a medium of exchange for influence
      - btw: VOTE WITH YOUR DOLLAR!! you can vote with a buck every
        day. do not empower those who you strongly disagree with.
        - this is the strongest means we have for changing behaviors
          and preventing actions we don't agree with.
        - you can't really "vote with your dollar" in a communist
          system. this yet another reason its citizens are left *more
          disempowered* than in free market systems

  - at the end of the day, we've exchanged diffusion of influence via
    $$$ for diffusion via hierarchical social institutions (kinda
    repeat of above)
    - the state often not only monopolizes the mechanism of influence
      diffusion, but also of influence "creation"
      - religions organizations are banned for this reason. they
        "create" influence through their own systems that acts as
        competition for other social institutions
      - media organizations are tightly controlled, in part for a
        similar reason: media has power over the information people
        engage with.
        - the media can therefore affect what people want, what they
          spend their time thinking about, their long term goals, what
          discussions the start around the water cooler at
          work... yotta yotta

- IMO, regardless of the system

- here's an idea though: why shouldn't that "creation" of influence
  originate at the individual/family/community levels first?
  - it already does in many ways. e.g. someone invests in a degree in
    a burgeoning field: boom, the individual has more influence.
  - but knowledge is power and education confers influence to
    individuals in society. therefore, if we can create social
    institutions which enable us to quickly more efficiently educate
    people, then we should

- and if influence emerges from the bottom up, then it's advantageous
  to leverage and exclusivize influence over subgroups of people.
  - we all have people who influence us. Those who are subject to
    larger, more dispersed networks are subject to more
    influences. There is disparity in the level of influence from
    specific nodes to subgroups and individuals.

# [A Philosophical Battle](#a-philosophical-battle)

The major battle facing humanity today is philosophical. It may seem
technological, but it's not. It may seem the most urgent battle is
with nature or for resources, but it's not! The most crucial battle we
face in this decade and the next is philosophical: we must conquer
ourselves. Previous centuries have been defined by a clash of ideas
that emerge into the world as social instituions and because of our
hyperconnected society, this is exhibited moreso and faster.

We have to be intimately familiar with understand how forces we can't
imagine will change our lives. Known unknowns, unknown knowns, and
most importantly unknown unknowns. Humanity's metamorphosis here won't
be efficient, so how can we prepare the cultures of 2030 to count on
the fluid nature of information to stay lean and stay agile? Again,
this stands in stark contrast to the typically slow pace of social
engineering projects.

### [It's Not My World. I'm Just Living In It](#its-not-my-world-im-just-living-in-it)

- in aggregate, these artificial walls and blocking mechanisms are
  incredibly harmful to people and to society.
  - more about this

Throughout the ages, people have burdened by artificial limitations
imposed by their belief systems, which are crafted to unify the
actions of the masses to some end. Walls are imposed and blocks are
placed in front of people to compel them towards cooperation towards
goals, many of which were in place before birth.  In most cases, the
individual is compelled to choose between struggling for their own
dreams or giving those up and contributing towards some
[Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_opus_(alchemy))
[Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Work).

The individual expends energy to change his local social environment,
which consists of other individuals, connected by social state
manifest as information and beliefs. In such an understanding of the
social graph, an individual can leverage his spirit, or capacity to
conduct energy, to alter his surroundings by influencing either the
beliefs of individuals or by changing the belief systems themselves.
These belief systems are essentially programs built on the platform of
the social graph and deployed to the infrastructure of individuals and
social institutions with varying degrees of penetration.

Here, there is a struggle between pre-determinism and free will. How
much of life is the result of pure spirit, lensed by the mind to
transcend the preexisting state one is born into?

(more here...)

In the 21st century, our tendency to succumb to

- preexisting state
- and the effect of belief systems

... ends because of the tendancy towards omnipresence of
information. That is, belief systems themselves will tend to decohere,
then recongeal into a either a unified belief system or set of belief
systems. This doesn't mean older belief systems will fade away
entirely, but ...

### Why are so many people encumbered with problems outside of their control?

- the question then becomes: why do so many people end up living in
  situations which are outside of their control or which they believe
  are outside of their control? *and then: how do we minimize these
  things?*
  - what is it that burdens us with problems that require expenditure
    or time or some other form of influence?
  - and how can we minimize such things at a micro-scale, so that it
    makes a difference on a larger scale

###

- A myriad of factors contribute to conditions precipitating
  poverty. no two regions, cities, neighborhoods or families are
  affected by these factors in exactly the same way.
- data science can be leveraged to counter instances of these factors
  in the social and financial graphs.
  - as goals, expectations and success of programs like these are
    already evaluated to encourage competition over funding, data
    science can further augment our capacity to predict and evaluate
    the expected impact of social programs.

- leveraging ideas from economics as metaphors for a framework to
  counter poverty by retooling our approach to funding these programs
  with a focus on encouraging competition.
  - this is a set of concepts that preserve some meaningful
    relationships to the matching set of concepts of economic theory,
    which can derive insights from signals emerging from the financial
    graph.
  - this is instead focused on signals emerging from a social graph,
    and identifying dynamics resembling those such as supply and
    demand.
    - signals emerging from the social graph might indicate the need
      to scale up efforts to mitigate instances of factors
      contributing to poverty.
- Supply and demand are essentually dynamics in an economic system
  arising from gradients on various metrics of the system. There are
  similar dynamics found in systems based on the social graph, as well
  as in the system itself. The dynamics emerging from social systems
  strongly influence the behavior of the system. Whereas the metrics
  emerging from the structure of the social graph are not dynamics,
  per se, they can form the basis of measures applicable to scopes and
  contexts of structures in the graph.
  - These form gradient-like objects that give way to higher order
    dynamics in the system, complicated by the roles of belief and
    information and their prevalence in the system, real or perceived.
  - These metrics are aggregate functions that operate on the local
    graph structure surrounding an individual's node, e.g. producing a
    count of the individual's connections within n-degrees of
    separation. They can be differentiated in various ways across the
    graph, enabling set operations on nodes that can be used to
    determine the set of mutual friends, for example. Because of the

  then economic theory would probably identify an increased demand for
  employment there.

    - (i'm having a hard time thinking of a good example of a problem
      that can be meaningfully responded to in the short term.)

- Many social problems correlate strongly to metrics based on an
  individuals one-degree and two-degree connections. These metrics
  include number of connections, qualities of connections, number of
  interactions, qualities of interactions, and many other. There are
  some social graph metrics which may not seem to be direct drivers
  for specific kinds of problems. However, simple metrics such as
  number of connections, frequency of interaction and number of
  interactions can be powerful indicators of developing and existing
  problems or pronounced vulnerability to them. Elderly people
  sometimes become isolated late in life, which exacerbates problems
  or reduces the scope of options available.
  - Developing confidence in data science on social phenomena is
    difficult, but many of these metrics are straightforward: number
    of friends increases, number of interactions increases, etc.

- The point is to develop a consistent social graph
  - When people are isolated, this can result in susceptibility to
    specific problems or exacerbating their consequences. If you

    especially second and third order effects.

### Applying some of these ideas towards poverty

- and particularly I'm talking about poverty: how can we focus on
  cleaning up the kinds of problems which keep people encumbered with
  poverty?
  - our most valuable tool here is education.
    - how do we get people to embrace educational opportunities? how
      do we prevent gradual aversion of populace to education during
      our approach towards the singularity?
    - advances in technology, coupled with changes to society, are the
      primary reason i'm excited about this
  - one major tool (which intertwines with education)
    - cognitive development via the arts.
      - (expand on cognitive/metacognitive devlepment)
  - other tools include:
    - social engineering
      - institutions, subcultures, common practices, and (?) to focus
        on building sociological/psychological elements that push
        towards a common goals of:
        - interdependence
        - opportunity
        - influence creation/diffusion for society on the micro scale:
          individual/family/local/community
          - there are many initiatives for doing a lot of this
      - (e.g. app idea) identify citizens on social media or IRL who are
        isolated and find out why!
    - hmmm... others?

  technology to develop our minds.
  - We can transform our society through cognitive expansion.

###

*Ultimately, Bolsheviks were deceived into becoming serfs for another
master, **with fewer options for transcending societal limitations**.*
Most of the left that hasn't studied political science, economics or
philosophy doesn't truly understand the post-revolution mechanics of
influence in communist and far-left societies. The left claims the
implementations of marxist and socialist ideas will reprieve the
burdens of the poverty unto which they were cursed by birth.

There are various strata of leftists, which determines their beliefs
and course of actions. Some are well-educated and some are
unfortunately not. Still, socialism and communism appeals to those
suffering in poverty and looking for someone to help them out. Some on
the far left very clearly do understand what they are doing to America
and the world, as obseqious as their tactics might be.

A pure marxist implementation of communism doesn't allow for wealth as
a means of influence whatsoever. Interest rates are simply too high
because of the macroeconomic policies used for centrally-planned
economies, so savings can't be accumulated without tremendous
sacrifice. This is by design and anyone saving too much is targeted as
a threat or expected to adhere to the interests of the
Party. Otherwise, poverty experienced in the developed world can be
transcended through hard work, virtuous behavior, avoidance of
destructive behavior, accumulation of savings and education.

###

Communism robs people of the ability to use capital and savings for
social influence. Just ask anyone who couldn't escape a Soviet
satellite state. Many people end up in such poverty that they couldn't
leave if they wanted to: *you cannot save money*. That is not to say
that free-market democratic societies are perfect. However, if we make
a hard left, we *will* find ourselves in a hole that is much deeper
and much harder to climb out.  Communist and far-left nations target
dissenting citizens to cull threats early and monopolize social
influence by compelling anyone with power to be "connected" to the
Party.

The only way to raise yourself in society is through compliance with
the Party, which installs a cult of personality in lieu of
religion. Institutions then encourage clever hacks of social mechanics
as common cultural practices to effectively short-circuit any possible
resistence, identifying and sorting the most vocal/passitionate
support. By encouraging carniverous behavior, one disempowers
resistence, motivates through fear, filters influential positions for
loyalty and encourages logistic turnover in organizations, which
ensures no one has a foothold long enough to gain their bearing to
manifest as a threat to power. It's like musical chairs.

Why did Stalin push for world revolution? Because the economics of
communism are only sustainable via empire and that's what it is: serfs
changing one master for another. An advance through Poland and into
Europe was planned before WW2 because the architects of Soviet
communism needed to power the services Bolsheviks promised with
economic expansion. Stalin anticipated resistence from the traditional
European powers.

### quantifying social mobility

analyze linkedin/career/financial data science
- quantify vocality of political affiliation in archived social media
  data. same for other indicators: religion, ethnicity, etc
- by meshing this data, we should be able to develop an approximate
  measure of social motility and average social progress per political
  group. can also measure along other lines, but not kosher.
  - bc i think what we'll see is that conservative americans have been
    effectively marginalized from society by design. and this can be
    measured with analytics and social media data analysis.
  - name of factor being measured? ~social mobility?~

###

- Social programs should be structured around a framework and platform
  that encourages competition over funding.
  - this framework should facilitate understanding of ROI for social
    programs, particularly in how the funding affects the social
    and financial graphs.

    people in the long run.


### why does it matter today?

- (separate article?)
- (more about these infuriating, manipulative tactics)
  - abusing social institutions and social mechanics
  - online discussions are coopted by trolls and a distict flavor of
    hiveminded ignorance, ...
  - effective censorship by newsfeed, especially for specific topics
    - this corrals discussion into controlled groups with limited
      exposure, with moderator censorship by veto.
      - only one moderator needs to disagree with your content for
        whatever reason for it to be effectively censored without
        explanation. it's quite often suppressed anonymously, though
        perhaps without malicious intent
    - ![In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream]
    - how does this change the 22nd century's perception of events
      today, if almost everything was suppressed and unindexable?
      content is unindexable when it can't be accessed by search
      engines. AFAIK, this includes almost all of facebook, except
      public posts. facebook benefits from having exclusive control
      over copyrighted content, so this is their motivation for
      excluding google/etc by default. facebook does archive their own
      data, but when this archived data is mostly exclusive, it makes
      the data statistically easier to manipulate in a cohesive way.
      - when people look back on history a century from now, what they
        will see is everything broadcast on TV and a deluge of
        information from *some* social media.
  - NSA utilizes social media manipulation to effectively mute
    dissenters online.
    - these tools in the wrong hands could empower a dictator
    - we built the machinery a totatitarian government could only
      dream of. we did it in secret, without discussion.
- there is a major push to socially encourage self-censorship
  - "oh, don't post things like that publicly. it will hurt your
    chances of getting a job... blah, blah, blah"
  - sociocultural incentives like this compel the far majority of
    people into self-censorship.
- the NSA has its tendrils in practically every technology company, so
  if you're restricted from speaking via NDA's with Google, Facebook
  or whoever, that means you can't speak out ... or your career is
  over.
  - the only people that can speak out are the extremely intelligent
    people who slipped under the radar who, for whatever reason, gave
    up the pursuit of a Silicon Valley career and just didn't give a
    fuck about everything else that might be taken away from them if
    they spoke out.
  - this is rare, because if you are intelligent in America, you are
    identified early on and they get your blinders on by undergrad at
    the latest. that is, you are encouraged to focus intently on
    specific problems *and nothing else*. the college system
    encourages the development of highly specific sets of knowledge
    - then you are burdened with a student loan and most people have
      no choice but to get straight to work.
    - you are controlled by debt and that's how debt works. it limits
      your choices in life.
  - as for me, I spoke out, but I never realized what was happening to
    me or how it was affecting my life. I didn't understand that
    people had methodically dissected my psychology and were
    surreptitiously distorting my social environments to push others
    away.

- math for scoring the 'health' of a person's local social graph and
  local financial graph.
  - is it possible to do this in an anonymous way?
  - observing that strong gradients in wealth and social influence
    gradually disperse
  - these metrics and methods for understanding/quantifying social
    influence need to be strongly and openly critiqued to ensure the
    model is accurate
    - it's easy to be deluded by the results of an invalid model and
      become overly confident in statistical analysis
    - these statistical models are structuralist and this is what the
      soviets thought could provide the perfect administration of
      society
      - these models are inherently fallible, but tempting for both
        those who would use them righteously and those who would use
        exploit them for power
    - however, statistical models powered by social media metrics can
      provide unprecedented insight into society.

- For america, we need democracy and capitalism. **America needs
  democracy because of the general protections on an individual's
  rights**: *speech, religion, property, life, liberty, ... pursuit of
  happiness and whatnot!*
  - however, because of how technology nature changes information &
    communication, it makes democracy less efficient & less likely to
    represent individuals
  - that doesn't mean it can't work or the people can't have power, it
    just means that our system needs to adapt to how information flows
    and how fast it spreads through a system.

#### How the government systematically disempowers people

Surprise! When the government has collected a wide swath of
information secretly, your communications render your psychology an
open book. Worse, like a bad shrink, you can never validate what’s
been written down about you. So, if the gov’t is killing you softly,
you’d never know. And worse, if the national security apparatus
mistreated you, it will continue to justify it’s previous actions
post-facto with more bad information in the secret file you can’t
verify .... until you “go away.” So you will continue to be
psychologically harassed by strangers programmed with that bad intel
who push people away to ensure that no one gets close enough to their
mistake to ever verify the truth, basically until you commit suicide.
