- psychosocial churn in sociohierchical structures is a tool of power
  - this is because people reorient themselves to the information
    available to them, but not all information becomes available to
    everyone immediately. there is always informational dissonance,
    delayed convergence and the informational convergence is never
    total.

- [To
  Whipsaw](https://www.merriam-webster.com/news-trend-watch/us-stocks-experience-whipsaw-20180206)

- most people don't understand social physics. it would never occur to
  them to reason about these things with math, especially early on in
  life because to them society, life and social interactions are all
  about feelings.
  - they may think about the network affect or generally gravitating
    towards more influential people. as people socially develop, they
    may begin to intuitively understand some sociophysical phenomena
    by reflecting on their experiences, but it depends on their
    natural emotional intelligence, variety of experience and
    metacognition.
  - people must understand how to function in their local social
    environments (i.e. the relationships in work/school/family), but
    they don't necessarily *need* more than that. therefore, it is
    certainly possible to function in these relationships, regardless
    of the qualities of those relationship dynamics
    - (e.g. it is possible to "function" in relationships that are
      healthy, unhealthy or even toxic, without being consciously
      aware of:
      - what it is you do that is contributing to the relationship
      - what the other person is doing for you or what you are getting
        out of the relationship, etc
    - therefore, it is possible for someone who is naive to have a
      completely ignorant understanding of life & society to function
      well within certain bounds. most of the relationships this
      person will form are not critical to the levels in their
      maslovian hierarchy of needs -- though a handful of those
      relationships certainly are.
      - that is, out of the ~150 relationships that the average person
        can concurrently participate in, only some of those are
        critical to that person's ability to maintain psychosocial
        stability in their lives
        - (maslovian as in the pyramid: (1) food/shelter, (2) ... )
    - it is perfectly ordinary for someone *ordinary* to maintain
      their relationships without understanding the underlying
      psychosocial mechanics of those relationships.
      - immature/young people ordinarily do.
      - but, as one zooms out to higher social scales, those
        less-naive people on the other end of those relationships
        ALMOST ALWAYS HAVE BETTER UNDERSTANDINGS OF PSYCHOSOCIAL
        DYNAMICS
        - this is especially true in relationships where the "higher"
          end confers power to the more naive person

    - thus, there are intergenerational and class-based dynamics
      here. the older generation and the higher classes have more
      knowledge about interpersonal relationships, their underlying
      psychosocial mechanics and the dynamics that emerge
      - therefore, there's a gradient that emerges. the socially
        vulnerable -- those who are younger, more naive or less
        affluent -- always face an uphill battle, but the battle is
        primarily informational.
        - furthermore, if you don't receive a certain variety of
          experience, you can never attain the kind of intuitionistic
          understanding of the psychosocial mechanics that underly
          interpersonal relationships.
    - to move upwards in society, you have to appease those with
      power/influence. yet, if you are naive and appease those
      relationships that confer to you influence/salary/etc, you may
      not understand at all what you are contributing to the
      relationship that they want.
      - this understanding perfectly describes how suburban America
        contributes to the banking industry, while being completely
        ignorant of what it does for big banks that keeps the magical
        chocolate factory of Big Banks and Wall Street happy
        - you simply know that: you go to work, you pay your mortgage,
          you keep your house AND YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT CERTAIN
          THINGS
          - if you do all these things, you don't have a problem with
            willy wonka. if you don't know the "certain things" you
            don't talk about, no problem.
          - however, if you actually want to change things -- and
            specifically, if you want to change things that relate to
            the banking sector -- you kind of need to know about those
            things you don't talk about.
          - if you come from a lower/middle class family, you're not
            going to go about that in the right way and you're
            invariably going to run into problems.
     - KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. and in class warfare, knowledge is scarce
       -- the aristocrats keep it that way. however, you can find
       yourself in the middle class -- perhaps the upper middle class
       if you're lucky -- and you don't need to know anything that
       threatens anyone in the highest echelons of aristocracy.
       - just keep in mind -- you might be free range, but you are not
         free. there are certain bounds and if you wander outside
         those bounds, retribution is swift.

- inverse correlation b/w size of a language pair membrane and
  quantity of informational flux moving through each social node
  - less people to facilitate movement of information through the
    "membrane" and those people facilitate more information transfer
    - it's also limited by the arrangement of people in the space, if
      it's a physical space. they can't translate/etc if they aren't
      face-to-face.
    - similarly, limited by the previously existing establishment of
      social connections if its a virtual space.
    - it's also limited by the bandwidth of those nodes
  - logarithmically(doublcheck?) correlated to the quantity of flux (more
    information to move or more opportunities/need for communication,
    then logarithmically more flux through each node)

- kino (episode 10) and social physics
  - episode where the town is destroyed by the volcano

- conversation and stochastic graph traversal (not purely random)
  - over long periods of time, when you look back and think about the
    things that people choose to *never* talk to you about...
    - specific facts that would have helped you uncover semantic
      connections pieces of information

- "theta clear" as a Social Physics perpetual motion machine
  - "It's rare -- and no you don't need scientology to do it. It means
    the person is inconsequential, but -- at the risk of sounding like
    a megalomaniac -- their will has attained a kind of
    self-perpetuating phase change"
  - there is no equilibrium preserved, but there are equilibrium-like
    dynamics though. in many ways, the non-linear system begins moving
    toward equilibrium when it is strongly out of equilibrium.
    - in one such way, those people how have power keep it close to
      them, but the people farther away who are strong in
      heart/mind/spirit, but suffer from lack of power will attempt to
      provide their own sociophysically local alternative to the power
      structures of the elite.
      - people naturally seek to insulate themselves from
        externalities (especially when unpleasant/corrupt/(greedy)) by
        reinterpreting how they perceive reality and helping those
        around them do the same.
      - when people are strong in heart/mind/spirit, they are
        strong/smart enough to cultivate power structures of their own
        and begin complementing/competing with other sociophyscially
        local power structures.
    - therefore, (in some aspects of social physics) when the pendulum
      swings one way, it always begins to naturally swing in the other
      way(s). it is usually both by (harnessing/aligning with) the
      collective unconscious and by (machiavellian methods) that the
      elite retain power, in spite of the pendulum's swing.
      - it is by aligning with God, fate and/or the collective
        unconscious -- if you even consider them different phenomena
        -- that you can be in eternal conflict with your adversaries
        while they desperately chase you and yet unknowingly follow
        you.
      - the truth is that by aligning yourself with fate, you identify
        the points/areas through which society and humanity *must*
        cross in order to move forward. regardless of whether your
        friends or adversaries believe this spaces to be preposterous,
        (moral/ethical), heretical, blasphemous or predestined, it
        doesn't matter.
        - if you are truly in that place, they will have no choice but
          to follow you into it, regardless of who they are or what
          ideas they represent.
        - because this understanding descends not from a materialistic
          conception of metaphysics, it is basically blasphemous to
          those in science, statecraft and some religious institutions
          today. though these same authorities might retort any
          accusations of witch hunting or (notions of their
          institutions as responding to blasphemy), this is exactly
          what it is. the rationalist world essentially reviles
          idealistic metaphysics.
          - most of them never bother to entertain metaphysics or
            outline the collective unconscious -- that is, all but the
            most elite who are terrified that others might be capable
            of anticipating their strategies/tactics in the future or
            unveiling them in the past.
            - so, if your are particularly good at this and you
              consistently flip the table and whip the carpet off the
              floor to show everyone all the dirt and muck beneath it,
              you will find yourself on a stake, burnt as a witch --
              metaphorical fuel to fan the flames of hatred for you
              and everyone like you.

=========

=========

- dichotomy between data-driven coarse-grained sociophysical models
  and the actual ground truth of individual's beliefs
  - it's simply intractible to take into account each individuals
    actual beliefs, so coarse-graining (from quantum physics) is
    required to generalize
    - but those generalizations, and particularly the extrapolations
      they produce, are not necessarily attached to reality.
    - the interesting philosophical question is -- how much space is
      there between the coarse-grained models of data science and the
      actual individuals' views/beliefs?
      - how can this be used? generally, how can the space between the
        computable and incomputable be used? (at least, as it pertains
        to social phenomena)

#### Differences Between Coarse-Grained Modeling for Quantum Physics and Social Physics

- how do coarse-grained models differ b/w quantum physics and social
  physics (where data & beliefs are inschematic)
  - tensor network for large scale geoeconomic/geosocial networks
    - especially modeling particle/information transfer
    - modeled as a kind of partial diff-eq -- with a "geo-graph"
      structure, a mix of a graph and a space -- where the state of
      the diff-eq decides the position/distribution of information
      processing/transferring
      - it's a diff-eq where the current/initial values specify the
        structure of the "geo-graph" which itself decides the
        interactions that are possible
      - viz. imagine the world b/w 1,000 BC and 1,000 AD and now,
        model an *approximate* sociophysical simulation, where the
        population distribution may change, as might the
        distribution/trade of resources
    - how can a tensor network model something like this efficiently?
    - how would such a tensor network relate to Nash's proof for
      special cases of the Heat Equation
      - vibrating particles, resonating with much higher-dimensional
        information than simply kinetic/thermal energy
      - does this actually connect to Nash's proof?

- S/Phys (X) euclidean path integrals
  - how does this interact with coarse graining?


- the difference b/w being formally and informally judged by society
  - if you're informally judged, each person reacts to you and the
    aggregate effect is in proportion to the quantity of people who
    know
    - i.e. you commit some crime and technically get away with it, but
      everyone knows it and feels compelled to secretly judge you
      - perhaps by controlling certain s/phys aspects of your life,
        such as the way other's perceive you
      - the specific labels that others apply to you and choose to
        propagate are chosen ad hoc, based on the information
        available to them.
    - when informal, it is limited by the rate of new interactions and
      the variance of recent interactions
      - but since it's informal, no one knows when to stop meting out
        the judgment.
    - connect (semiotic/semantic)-meaning-mappings and the
      relationship of various enumerable mapping-combinations,
      especially as it relates to the Birthday Paradox
  - if you're formally judged, you're given some formal label that's
    projected through society, especially by social institutions.
    - here, the institutionally-applied labels are well-defined and
      the means of propagation are well-known
      - awareness of this information can propagate into society upon
        the occurance of certain events (new job, background check,
        etc)

- these formal/informal means of defining/choosing/propagating labels
  is part of a continuum.
  - people decide upon signs (both signifiers and signified) in groups
    - here, signifiers can include: body language, specific locution,
      the display/adherence of a social norm/tradition/etc, an
      abstract label
    - each person has their own understanding of the signfier and
      signified, but people tend to seek consensus of abstraction and
      information.
      - therefore, at groups of various sizes, people harmonize their
        abstractions, including their definitions of
        signifiers/signifieds
    - but social institutions, language and other human inventions
      tend to reify these abstractions into discrete code/symbols.
      - then the basis for these more formal definitions is (definite)
        - i.e. it is definitively captured in law/language
        - still, each person can develop their own interpretation of
          (institutionally harmonized datums)

#### {Set the reader's frame}

- what does it mean to have zero for some of these metrics?
  - no, really: in each metric for each category above, what do the
    concepts of zero, identity, mean (additive and geometric), range,
    independence, connectedness, etc mean
  - set the frame of the reader by asking them to consider this as the
    read the article, then discuss it in further detail later

- sociophysical analysis of diplomatic protocol and etiquitte protocol
  modalities, norms and deviations

### Social Mechanics

#### Psychosocial [Valence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(psychology))

- valence (psychological, sociological & informational)
- applications of the valence effect -- "chemistry"
- abuse of the
  [Valence Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_effect) in
  antifragile networks of agency, where information is covertly
  managed with zealously utilitarian tactical efficiency to retain
  advantage in all situations when managing a "cancer on society"
- mathematically accounting for the psychosocial dynamic of "opposites
  attract" for basic/sophisticated personality types
  - psychological "valence"
  - if connections and interactions b/w people are facilitated
    alleviating the gradient of disparity of knowledge/information,
    then what does this say generally about people who are basic and
    people who are well-educated
    - what are the psychosocial dynamics that emerge between
      combinated pairings/groupings of people
      - how do these dynamics change when people have various ranges
        of aggregate knowledge levels or various ranges of knowledge
        levels in specific fields
  - this becomes more complicated when considering the same problem
    for various types of knowledge (i.e. level of sophistication in
    various fields)
  - but, generally, people who have a higher disparity in
    knowledge/information from different fields will have more to talk
    about or more value to offer each other in terms of the knowledge
    they have to share.
  - "if you're the smartest person in the room, find another room."
- typologies of variation in psycho/socio/cultural dimensions,
  quantified with social media data.
- exploiting social media filter bubbles to create false consensus
  effect in targets, which can contribute to gaslighting campaigns

### (physical conditions => sociophysical conditions)

- explore how physical conditions & possibilities affect
  sociophysical metrics, like temperature (average motion of
  people), frequency of novel interactions, etc...
  - how do weather conditions affect the players and the game?
  - how do weather conditions affect the home & visiting crowd

- in this section, use stadium metaphors
  - people behave differently in the shaded sections than in the
    hotter sections. this is the transduction of physical forms of
    energy to social forms of energy.
  - literally the wave. a GIF of the wave in a stadium.



# (Physics Analogies for Social Systems)

The speed of information is just one quantifiable social metric whose
momentary (scale) lead profoundly impacts interaction across
society. Just like thermal energy, sociophysical system operate with,
preserve and disperse energy, but this energy can usually be
defined in infinitely many ways.

  - (succinctly describe other metrics at a high level, that were
    easily observable by people throughout history, whose trends could
    be anticipated)
  - distribution of information
  - spectrum of available information
  - spectrum of modes of communication
  - value of information

- people as particles: temperature, density, state, etc.
- speed of sound
- phase changes
- configurational entropy & conformational entropy

### Tempurature

- should this be moved to an article on social physics?
- the ideas of "temperature" and "energy" for the high-dimensional
  systems of social physics
  - spatial or physical temperature/energy/motion
  - the more metaphysical, high-dimensional temperature/energy of
    information

- social physics temperature, induced by sunrise
  - informational movement from east to west
    - increasing "temperature"

### Speed of Information Transfer



### Particles and Molecules

- (note up front that everything in this paragraph is overly
  simplified. rename people as particles and describe it as a
  simulation)
- IRL social interactions are constrained by the spaces they occur in.
  - if viewed top-down in 2D, geometric patterns emerge.
  - this is where the physics interactions get interesting because, if
    you idealize them to a sociophysical model, people interact with
    shared fields, just like particles do.
    - there are fields that attract and repel. there are fields that
      are far more complicated than any in physics, like the shared
      field of attention.
    - when interacting, people try to harmonize the space between each
      other. they like to be close when they are interested in the
      interaction, but not too close.
      - so in an overly simplistic model, they influence a shared
        field that causes them to repel and attract each other.
    - but, people are constantly reading each other and there is this
      shared field of attention that emerges.
      - people have a natural urge to know what other people are
        interested in. so, they subconsciously read signals that
        indicate attention
        - imagine a 2D space with a heat map that shows everyone's
          average object of attention
        - they are naturally pulled towards the areas of the heatmap
          that are strongest.
        - they are pulled towards the gradient of the laplacian of the
          group's influence on the shared field of attention... (reword
          this)
        - IRL, it's not so simple.

- then you can define rules that determine which particles can
  transmit information
  - they have to be within some minimum distince to "connect"
  - once they are connected to a group, the simulation's interactions
    have a set rules
  - but particles should form groups that resemble molecules, but
    because of how the particles simultaneously repel and attract each
    other, they form a fairly limited set of molecule shapes.
    - the shapes are primarily circular (2-6 people can easily circle
      together and talk in a fairly noisy space)
    - but then, depending on how each particle's attention affects
      their behavior and physical orientation, these primary shapes
      can merge to form more complex shapes.
  - these group connections have a logical graph structure that is
    imposed ontop of the physical structure (the shape of the
    "molecule")
    - IRL, people are moreso thinking about the logical structure when
      they interact, but the physical structure also matters.

- the geometry that emerges in IRL social interactions also adheres to the
  spatial constraints.
  - the physical arrangement of objects in the space contributes
    heavily to range of possibilities for interactions that emerge,
    but also strongly shapes the physical and logical geometry of
    group interactions.
    - feng shui helps us think about this aspect of social
      interactions
  - this sounds complicated, but isn't. if there's a restaurant with
    ten tables in one of its rooms, the people who sit down can only
    arrange themselves in specific ways.
    - this is similar to "holes" in N-doped and P-doped silicon
      transisters, if we're overly eager for physics analogies.
  - so, the physical arrangement of the space and functional specifics
    of its objects tends to constrain the configurational and
    conformational entropy of interactions in the space.

### The sociophysical equivalent to E = m * c^2

- what is mass (maybe establish this earlier)
  - or since all of these ideas are physical analogies extended to
    social systems: what could be represented meaningfully by
    mass/energy, while preserving adjacent relationships
    - (m = dV; F = Ma; etc. ...)

- at what point do these analogies become a stretch? do i even care
  anymore? i mean ... really?

### Reynold's Number

- (reynold's number)
  - describes the parameters at which turbulent fluid flow
    emerges. (but what is turbulence for high-dimensional
    sociophysical particle systems)
  - Reynold's Number is closely related to the Speed of Sound

### Information's Speed of Sound

- what determines Mach-One in sociophysical spaces?
  - population density, transportation methods, etc



# Critical Metrics for Sociophysical Systems

- connect these to the 7 hermetic principles

### General/Specific Speed of Information Transfer

- the speed at which any piece of information could travel

### Probabilities & Rates of Datum/Meme Expression

### Rates & Status of Convergence

- the definition of information convergence across a network
  - that is, at what percentage of people in a network would you
    consider the piece of information common knowledge?
  - this is an important metric because its definition affects
    "velocity" of convergence or "distance remaining" to convergence
  - what are the specific ideas from math that define this in abstract
    terms?
    - this would concern metrics of convergence for graphs and is
      probably related to entropy

- the length of time it takes for an urgent piece of information to
  converge across a network.

- (better word than convergence?)
  - consensus?

### Information Permanence

- the degree of repition or replication that's required for
  information to achieve permanence, with various levels of technology.
  - before writing, only highly-prioritized information would be
    achieve convergence through replication.
  - after the printing press, ...

### Informational Entropy

- shannon entropy (i.e. informational entropy) related to the
  more abstract structure of information
  - in other words, what kinds of information, messages and ideas are
    most people going to talk about
  - in a language or character set, this is easier to define.
  - in this context, the structures and variations you are measuring
    are infinite
  - this measure of entropy is important for understanding how to
    distract and disguise.

### Sociophysical and Dirichlet Energy

- measures of energy for information transfer/convergence
  - literal physical energy required to transfer information
  - dirichlet energy (?)
    - this is a generic measure of energy. what are some specific
      examples of applying this idea to sociophysical systems?

### Information Network Flux Dynamics

- the quantity, qualities and dynamics of information flux networks.
  - do nodes exchange information at regular times? with what degree
    of certainty?
  - which nodes exchange information? how often? how much?
    - are any of these things predictable?
      - you'll find that, the more physically bound a social system
        is, the more confidant you can be in predicting/anticipating
        these things.

### Information Network Structure & Superimposition

- measuring/analyzing the graphs/networks in sociophysical systems
  - (are there better terms for these ideas? it'd be better to find
    the right terms from math/physics)
  - interpersonal networks viewed as graphs
    - hierarchical structures: identifying subgraphs ... which are
      self-similar
    - identifying boundaries in the graphs
    - identifying geographic boundaries with a higher capacity to be
      "expander graphs" for the global system (reword this?)
      - this describes america/europe and other areas with diverse
        populations. these areas are more tightly connected with the
        rest of the world.
      - this well-connected aspect of america's social network can be
        leveraged as an asset. (soft power, economic development,
        etc.)
        - expander graph may not be the appropriate term, but
          describes a graph that is maximally connected from any node,
          while having a relatively minimal number of connections.
        - so, from any arbitrary node, you can find a minimal path to
          any other node in the graph. (viz. it's an efficiently
          structured graph. the complete graph is not a good expander
          graph because it's not efficiently connected)
        - AFAIK, the human brain functions as an expander graph with
          some other regular structure

### Permeability and Diffusion

  - analyzing the sociophysical dynamics of information diffusion
    - are some areas more porous?
      - more likely to retransmit information?
      - more likely to absorb new information?
    - how do differences in language affect the transmission of
      information?

### Generic Concepts of Regularity in the System

- measuring the regularity of phenomena in the system

- measuring the different kinds of flux in a system

### Agents, Vessels and Vectors for Information Dispersion

- (REMOVE: already described)
- vessels for containing information
  - (these aren't metrics, but there are important metrics related to
    them)
  - vehicles for moving information
    - foot, horse, car, signal fire
    - imagine your a shady villan from a disney movie and you need to
      stop a message from getting to your king.
      - you know it's a letter; you know the messenger left 5 minutes
        ago; there are X roads leading to X towns
      - you can order people to move as fast as they can to stop the
        messenger, but you need to know whether you can stop the
        message, otherwise you have to change your plans.
      - can you be sure the people you order can outrun a messenger,
        if you don't know who they are?
      - (change the specifics in this scenario?)
      - people have a set of options available to them to transfer
        information. the mechanics of each option is crucially
        important when trying to decide if the information can
        physically escape.

### Metrics of Sociophysical Spaces

- the position distribution emerging from the frequency of social
  particle positions in the space
  - the superposition of (path, velocity, etc) distributions that
    result in the position distribution
    - when particle paths emerge in the space that are abberrent, even
      automated systems analyzing video data can identify these and
      notify people to introspect the event for more information.
    - this is EASY, by the way.

# Social Physics and Machine Learning

- [VAIN: Attentional Multi-agent Predictive
Modeling](https://research.fb.com/publications/vain-attentional-multi-agent-predictive-modeling/)
  - summarize how social interactions are modeled in this paper
  - for inferring direction of soccer players' attention, does VAIN
    method take into account the difference between head orientation
    and momentum? (yes)
    - this isn't stated in the paper. the features are all handled
      fairly homogenously. still, the statistical ML method should
      cause *correlation* b/w head orientation & momentum to emerge...
  - the paper also mentions the idea of adding a RNN (recurrent neural
    network) to leverage several frames of data in the generation of
    output
    - adding this means the algorithm should then take into account
      fast/slow changes in heading.
      - for patterns of heading to become significant, the full 20hz
        SVPP dataset would need to be used, but these should be very
        significant.
    - by adding an RNN, i hope that the algorithm implicitly gains a
      better understanding of how players direct their attention by
      inferring via heading, momentum and (direction of momentum -
      heading)
      - this can be done using the GPU to render particle systems
        where player's action on the shared field of attention is
        rendered as a simple shape with gradient
        - some GPU blending optimizations dramatically speed this up
          for high-count particle systems (like *advanced*
          programmable blending ... not "programmable" blending)
        - multiple color channels, texture arrays for essentially more
          color channels, allow higher-dimensional data to be encoded
          and operated on in parallel
          - e.g. color channels for p1...p22 in P, and one each for
            P(x)P
            - ... yeh that expands tetrationally, but having that many
              color channels isn't necessary
        - for each color channel, find the maximums, then collapse the
          maximums into a list (using thrust::scan() on the GPU)
          - these are points of interest. higher-order sociophysical
            structures (like graphs) can now be inferred on top of the
            purely physical structures
            - the generation of this logical layer is highly specific
              to the activity and so are the design of computable
              algorithms to provide these higher-level data

  - other [probably incomputable] aspects for sociophysical sports
    simulations
    - sudden increases in ball velocity are correlated to changes in
      heading and (shortly thereafter) momentum
      - therefore, this changes a moreso macroscopic shared field of
        attention
    - multiple energy functions to measure how well the space is
      covered/blocked
      - correlate this to path finding through open spaces... which
        requires perfracted inferences (p1 must infer p12's spread of
        likely position changes)
        - path-finding in this situation touches on the
          "connectedness" of spaces (this is similar to conditions for
          reimannian manifold, but some areas of the field are
          "harder" to get to, not impossible)
        - path-finding through open space on the attention field
          (rendered to RGBA) is like a kind of gradient descent where
          you choose to pass or decide on which areas of the field to
          move to based on whether the home/away team has more or less
          control over that section of the field
      - rendering to multiple color channels and using morphology will
        be useful here
        - render attention fields for:
          - R: home^2,
          - G: away^2,
          - B: (home - away)^2
          - A: (home + away)^2
        - then players will gravitate towards and pass the ball
          through the gradient of (home - away)
        - morphology allows you to extrapolate the field to
          accommodate for potential field changes over time
          - open/dialate (but not just grayscale, use literal gradient
            to calculate how far the field changes)
    - configuration entropy & conformation entropy
      - deconstruct abstracted representations of soccer player
        interactions on the micro scale
        - 1on1: p1 has no momentum and p12 has a lot
        - 1on1 w/ goalie
        - 2on1: p1/p2 interact to overcome p12
      - by deconstructing configurations and comparing against
        config/conform entropy, algorithms can recognize the outcome
        to the micro of soccer interactions


#### CommNet/IN/VAIN for logically defined networks

- carry the methods from the VAIN paper over to logically defined
  networks (i.e. Facebook Graph)
  - extending the soccer example to a social graph for FB users:
    predict the next connections that people will leverage with
    interaction based on social/net/etc
    - based on what they are seeing now, the algorithm tries to
      predict their next interaction
    - consider (screen coverage (cm2) * time) ... probably won't
      correlate well

- similar to the VAIN algorithm above, the social media users have
  "motion" and "position" and "heading" but altered for virtual
  networks

- problems of scale when modeling superconnected online communities
  - can't see the whole graph (can barely see any of it) ... expand






# Equilibrium, Gradient and Laplacian in (poorly defined) Sociophysical Games

### Equilibrium Dynamics in Wordpress Work Referrals

- Say you're a web developer, but not so great at graphic design. a
  new acquaintance approaches you with a need for a new
  website. perhaps they ask you to work on it or maybe they just want
  some information, but it's clearly a potential sale.

- If you're a freelancer, what do you do? do you pursue the sale or do
  you recommend them to a friend?
  - if you're goal is building a small business, there is a correct
    answer: does this look like a good client who pays quick and in
    full? or at least a client connected to additional business?

- what about a friend of yours in the same situation?
  - would they refer the potential client to you or try to pursue the
    prospect themselves?
  - if they chose to refer you to the potential client, why did they
    select you?
    - (was it because it was a bad/inefficient client, lol)
    - you don't want clients that don't pay quick/readily. it burns
      you out and leaves you drained.

- while this isn't a situation with clear equilibrium dynamics, there
  is a clear game here:
  - how would you or your friend make your decision?
  - how does your decision affect your freelancing or small business
    over the next 6-12 months?
    - how can you know the client would help you grow?
    - can you assert whether the client is well-connected and is
      someone who might give you good referels?
      - people who don't have much but connections (if any at all)
        love to talk about their connections.
      - people with their shit straight don't need to talk about their
        connections. and if their connections are *really that good*
        (like celebs or a great agent) then their connections might
        not want to be tightly connected to someone who namedrops
        because they need to
        - besides, real people value themselves and their own
          authenticity. they don't need to namedrop to puff themselves
          up because they know how to get high on their own supply
          just fine. that said, everybody needs a good hype man
          ... just not any hype man.
        - real people who are down-to-earth value authenticity and
          produce social/financial value. "real recognize real". they
          speak through action, not words. they don't need to sell you
          on their network because they have what you need and if you
          don't want it, they know plenty of people who value them for
          their authenticity.
          - it's different in tinsel-town for sure.

- understanding the game above is crucial for anyone who wants to grow
  a small business. it's just as critical when deciding who to spend
  your time with or who to grow your life with.
  - people are too narcissistic these days to realize this quite
    often.
  - or they mistake social media success as being a good indicator for
    success in life.
  - i really don't care how many likes i get on my photos/posts. what
    irritates me is knowing that, since everything I post gets zero
    interactions, it means i'm filtered out of all newsfeeds and
    practically invisible to everyone glued to their phone.
    - this is particularly damaging to someone who has never been
      taught to cold-approach anyone in their life,
      - who's been defamed by a bunch of false information,
      - censored in social media
      - and chased out of a every social circle he tries to be part
        of, while no one can tell him why: jamskating, a web
        development career, startups, drug culture, the technology
        world, academia, bboying, hiphop...
      - everything i try to be a part of, people can't help themselves
        but try to figure out how to get rid of me as fast as possible
        because at least now I'm someone else's problem.
        - i'm too much of a risk, i'm too infamous and defamed (i'll
          bring the wrong kind of attention to them), i've pissed off
          too many people
        - people act like they'll look bad standing beside me because
          they're more worried about whether they'll be judged for
          being to close to someone who's all too easy to judge than
          simply being there for a person who's been systematically
          isolated
          - thank God I'm too autistic to be worried about backwards
            thinking like that. I've been too hurt all my life to
            worry about what other people might think of me for
            getting close to someone else who's been hurt. and group
            dynamics have never come naturally to me.

#### Side Track

  - whenever i find myself in the business referrel game above, I
    invariably pass because i can think of at least 5 people more
    skilld at *web design* who would be eager to do the work, would
    deliver it for a lower price, earn higher profit margins and would
    overall do a better job.
    - so i almost always recommend a potential sale to a friend
      instead. it has nothing to do with my capability.
    - instead, I die a little on the inside when i think about
      spending my time doing web design for pennies, instead of
      learning math, writing about philosophy, working on a backlogged
      startup idea, watching a lecture or doing almost anything else
      that I am driven to do.
    - i appreciate the people who've tried to help me with potential
      prospects for web design. however, i'm not good at graphic
      design or UI/UX and I know how much time it will take me to
      deliver compared to someone else and, ultimately, how much time
      it will detract from the pursuit of my true passions.
    - all of them and every one of them is worth far more money to me
      than starving, while i'm unhappy, spun out and distracted from
      my true goals in life.
      - it doesn't play out well when you try to explain this to
        someone who knows you do "web stuff" but doesn't understand
        why your asperger's brain isn't well-suited for UI/UX, graphic
        design and content writing for what amounts to a brochure
        website.
      - this person, after all is just trying to help you out. i know
        myself and i know my mind. what i would be doing is giving up
        on every dream to chase $500 or less for every client, ending
        up with `n` number of clients, whose websites I must maintain
        for little to nothing. once i have about 10 clients, all of my
        time instead becomes focused on responding to emails, thinking
        SLOWLY about graphic design, and supporting existing clients,
        while thinking about growing a small business I never wanted
        in Roanoke, where every web developer fights to the death over
        table scraps.

- whenever I pursue work, it's because the work appeals to some
  passion I have. furthermore, I will not contribute to or gain
  monetarily from something I fundamentally disagree with. I never
  have and I never will. I vote with my dollar and more importantly,
  I'll never give my sweat, my blood, my soul or a dollar to something
  I disagree with...
  - the point is, I don't want to waste my time chasing the first
    opportunity that comes along. if i work with you, it's never about
    dollars and cents first. it's because I find something you do or
    something about you important to changing the world, either
    directly or indirectly by empowering me to change things without
    empowering what i disagree with.






### Detecting Obsequity, Duplicity and Malice

- people will lie up and down about why they do the things they do
  - especially if their behavior is subversive and/or they are
    cooperating with others.
    - which is why this is a good way to see who really shares
      goals/motivations in a group
      - in otherwords, you *could* identify who is complicit in some
        subversive group behavior
      - by judging how people change their definition of equilibrium
        in various groupings
        - so persons A, B, C and D overtly share a goal
          - persons A and C and D are assholes to you when they are
            all together. because D is a dick and has an agenda and
            exerts influence over A and C.
          - person B doesn't like being a dick, but will act like a
            dick because he has to. D makes sure that B is a dick, but
            as long as D doesn't find out ... B doesn't want to act
            like that
          - etc etc.
      - basically, you can deduce how and why people act, especially
        when they have an agenda and they are required/motivated to
        do things.
        - their idea of their "resting place" for their behavior to
          acheive their equilibrium or goals changes between those
          sets depending on how other members of those sets exert
          influence on them in some hidden way.
          - this is the shit that keeps me up at night and i hate it
            because it's fucking bullshit
          - why can't we all get along?


### Discerning When Someone is Acting On Another's Behalf

- simple: is someone truly acting of their own volition or is someone
  acting on another's behalf
  - answering this question and the process of answering this question
    speaks volumes about someone's psychology and thought process

- someone acting on another's behalf: hired, contracted, financially
  rewarded, or otherwise incentivized
  - this person will always have boundaries placed on their behavior
  - the boundaries depends on their role. certain role types have
    different kinds of boundaries that you can sense
  - often, bad and extremely good situations involve interacting with
    someone who's contracted and obligated to someone else's interests
    who'd rather remain anonymous.
    - so if you can sniff this out early, you can clue yourself
      in. usually, the person who's trying to hide their true
      obligations from you doesn't have your best interests at heart,
      but this is not always the case.

- someone acting on their own volition:
  - can leave at any time
  - will immediately pursue better opportunities when presented
  - is executing their own program or their own set of behaviors that
    they've learned through life
    - but the important distinction is that they are not usually
      holding themselves bound to the obligations of their career bc
      they are not at work
      - though some careers require behavior that extends outside the
        workplace
  - is always, *always*, **always** looking for something
    - this "something" can sometimes be more abstract, but they are
      always trying to find something
    - the person looking for nothing is usually crazy, stupid or
      perhaps spiritual
      - but even people who state/appear to be looking for nothing are
        just masking their intent.
      - people (who mask their intent acting on their own volition
        (ambiguous)) ... are often ppl to be wary of
        - or they are just people who like privacy ...

- interesting deductions can be made about someone's psychology by
  reasoning about why and how they are adhering to someone's elses
  obligations or interests
  - i.e. they have a job/role & you know what that role is. you know
    what processes/logistics/decisions it entails. now you can make
    interesting deductions about their psychology by looking at how
    they are fulfilling their obligations or process requirements.
    - this is especially interesting when you know they are required
      to mask certain pieces of information from you.
  - e.g. the tinder "bot" trying to get you to sign up for their cam
    service. lulz, this one gets me every time. so fun to !@#$ with
    (not in a crude way)

### Sparse Graph With Concentric, Radial Flows of Informaion

- sparse graphs where almost all information flows are
  monodirectional, beyond some core subset of the network, tightly
  interconnected to itself and only sparsely connected to the outside.
  - in the inner shells, the networks allow for bidirectional
    connections within the shell, but only monodirectional connections
    outside the shell.
    - thus, in order to form cycles in outer, non-core shells, there
      must be at least two connections
- this monodirectional flow proceeds outwards from a kernel (i.e. the
  brain) messages can be passed using oblivious transfer, but require
  at least 3º or 4º of separation to move backwards against this
  monodirectional flow.
  - since this is communication amongst social graph nodes using
    oblivious transfer, the nodes who make those last 1-2º of transfer
    which actually sends the signals back upstream can't actually
    perceive that they're sending the messages upstream (and thus, to
    the source of the "mono"-directional signaling, which is the
    source of the "authority" in the network)
  - thus, will radiates outward from the concentric kernels of this
    social graph, projected through social graph loops of 3-4º, where
    direction and communication is always one direction (as it appears
    to the social graph nodes, anyways)
  - there is a most-central kernel, from which all directives emerge,
    this is the most central "brain"
    - there are a series of concentric kernels which encompass the
      brain. to the participants outside of the 2º social neighborhood
      of the "brain", all messages appear to radiate outwards. they
      are mostly processing oblivious transfers anyways.
      - only those nodes 2º or less from the brain know they can send
        messages inwards.
    - to the brain, all messages processed are conducted in loops,
      where all movement appears to be monodirection for the
      participants (from within the system at least)
      - for each loop that initiates and terminates within the same
        concentric neighborhood of the brain, there is an efferent
        pathway and an afferent pathway, just like the nervous system
    - for every social node in this system, there is some subset of
      their 1º social neighborhood that is part of the network. they
      may be aware of this and know what this subset is..
      - or they may not know the entire subset or they may not even be
        aware they are participating in any of this.
        - for the people directing the action of others, the less that
          people further from the center know, the better
      - anyways, for this subset that belongs to every node in the
        network, there are some members of this subset that are
        further outside from the brain, in an equivalent concentric
        "kernel" or actually upstream from them, in relation to the
        "brain"
        - however, the for each node, depending on how much they
          understand about this, they may not know who is upstream and
          who is downstream. to the people upstream, this is
          perfect. this is what keeps the nodes oblivious at least to
          the structure of the network, which is crucial.
          - they are conditioned to forward signals on the network and
            simply function as links to other nodes.
- this is not the only indexing scheme for sociophysical communication
  protocols. it is very similar to passing IP packets through routers,
  albeit quite a bit more destructured. all in all, if you are part of
  one of these networks, you can use it to pass messages along without
  understanding the path that they will take. the goal is to construct
  a network that is autonomous and decentralized.
  - there are many potential indexing schemes. this is simply one of
    them. the idea that ALL people on earth are separated by 6º or
    less is not true. these networks specifically extend the number of
    degrees of separation, although it's quite difficult to continue
    maintaining much more than 6º of separation today.

- TODO: explain more here

### Mandala Theory And Equilibrium

- reflect on some of the ideas from
  [Rajamandala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajamandala)
  [Arthashastra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthashastra)

- how do the ideas forming the basis of "mandala theory" influence the
  dynamics of equilbria in sociophysical games at various scales
  - how do they influence how sociophysical circuits on local scales?

- here, "local spheres" refers to neighborhoods in topological
  sociophysical spaces (physical or virtual)
  - for physical spaces, these metrics could be distance, travel time,
    communication time, travel/transport energy
  - how do physical aspects of these spaces affect the vibration and
    refraction of waves? & metrics like population density, geographic
    network size (network heartbeat & transit patterns)

- some factors can drive more competition b/w people and groups within
  highly local spheres
  - here, shared resources/energy are within reach
    - results of games and other information is made more readily
      apparent to those in highly local spheres
      - feedback loops are tight, diffusion of information is
        necessarily relayed & responded to at higher frequencies, as
        are the causal effects of its reflection
      - people respond to each other faster.

- those people you compete against locally are motivated to draw on
  their neighbors for the same types of things you might find
  advantageous to exploit/control
  - so, because your local neighbor competes against their local
    neighbors, now you and your 2&deg; have some incentives to
    cooperate against your neighbor.

- examples of this in recent history
  - nazi's and soviets in early 30's begrudgingly cooperated to move
    into poland.
  - after Napolean's failed attempt to conquer Russia, the french
    troops left behind formed the basis of a drawn-out, impromptu
    cultural diaspora.
    - this ended up seeding cultural connections to france. decades
      later, French and Russian academics and philosophers founded
      the roots of modern socialism.
    - France and Russia became like cultural/political poles of the
      European mainland and there was consistent churn between both
      throughout the rest of the 19th century
      - franco-prussian war

- as history progressed, speeds of communication increased, along with
  quantity/density of information available.
  - the effects described in the Mandala effect began manifesting
    along greater scales (but it's not only the distance grew at which
    these effects manifested)
  - it would seem that exponential increases in speed/density of
    communication in the 19th century would pace along with the
    changes to Rajamandala's theory's here.
    - however, that's not what happens: sociophysical spaces become
      less physical and more logical -- further, the models for
      mechanics on spaces become moreso parameterized by topologies,
      which diffuse effects faster and more widely
    - as stated in part one, the nature of sociophysical spaces shifts
      beneath our feet

- network theory and [Gilbat's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibrat%27s_law)

### "Fighting Shadows" or Defending Against "Hall of Mirrors"

- this tactic is only possible when someone obtains significant power
  and knows how to use it.
  - it is the decentralized, delegated nullification of someone's
    ability to attain specific kinds of equilibria
  - it works by causing the person to waste their sociophysical energy
    chasing things they can't have or by dealing with information from
    (old, old stories)
- most of the time, this is just what happens in a situation where
  conflict happened 5-10 years ago, one person lost and never gained
  ground, while the other person gained everything.
  - so ... it's not really a tactic or an element of a strategy, it's
    just what happens when you had a significant opportunity and lost
    to someone (who is perhaps extremely manipulative)

- the ultimate use of decentralized tactics, where you attain a
  critical threshold of power in a network
  - for those threats you fear now or in the future, if you have
    influence, you can disseminate information that gamifies other
    people's behaviors. you (INDIRECTLY) reward them with influence as
    they react to the disinformation.
    - that threat will be forced to redirect all his energy to the
      situations that arise, which leads towards total dissipation of
      your threat's sociophysical energy
    - they are always chasing equilibria they can't obtain

#### Anti-Focusing Turrets and Players

![Overwatch: how to beat a turret - compel the AI to rotate the turret b/w two targets]()

- "anti-focusing" (and connections to hypnosis?)
  - bc you have (significantly more) power, you are the power broker
    or gatekeeper for that network. no one will care about your former
    threats because they don't hold anyone's future in their hands.
    - at this point, if you'd like, you just make them a walking
      allegory, which could perpetuate the creation of disinformation
    - don't be like X: look what happened to his life after he did
      drugs. oh my god we feel *so bad* for him.

- when a manipulative opponent has gained an advantageous foothold
  around you, they want to ensure that your [group's] understanding of
  the situation remains sufficiently dissociated from the truth.
  - therefore they will lie, even when they do not need to, so that
    you [and your group's] understanding of the situation retains a
    shape that permits the adversary to understand how you will react
    in situations with similar metatypes
  - they want to know, from a perspective of type theory: in similar
    types of situations, how will you respond
  - the whole point in surrounding you with a "Hall of Mirrors" is to
    surround you with threat-like scenarios, each presenting you with
    choices to respond.
    - the people orchestrating manipulation around you will seek to
      keep you
      - (1) predictable and
      - (2) deceived
        - by gluing (from a functional/compositional math perspective)
          these perceived threats to fallacious causes that are
          sufficiently explicable
        - this way, the manipulative adversary can dupe you into
          acting against a quantifyable number of threats that they
          are testing you with
          - connection to metatype: they will goad you into acting
            against any perceived threat, so that they know how likely
            you are to act against the true culprits if you begin to
            understand the truth of the situation
          - they do this to goad you into displaying a measureable
            will to stand up for yourself, while convincing you to
            waste time fighting shadows in a hall of mirrors.

### *~* You are the five people you spend the most time with *~*






### Conversation Keepaway

- playing keepaway with an item of interest, such as a ball, requires
  2+ people to consciously participate in keeping the item away
  - this also has the side-effect of anti-focusing the target's
    energy, as they toggle their focus from one person to
    another. thus, the target's focus dissipates.
- conversation keepaway only requires one person to intend the game.
  - they can encourage group dynamics to emerge, while making their
    intent visible to others or shielding it from the group's
    awareness.
  - if the target is socially vulnerable or a bit slow/inexperienced
    when it comes to conversation, then it's trivial to identify when
    they want to add something to the conversation.
    - when they start talking, it's easy to regain control of the
      conversation within two or less statements by that person
  - this sounds crazy, but it really works. however, the same effect
    is produced when you have a group with several people who are full
    of themselves and eager to speak instead listening to others.
    - either one is not easy for socially vulnerable people to deal
      with. if they face these situations constantly, they will never
      develop conversational skills.
      - if one of your objectives is for them to remain
        socially/psychologically vulnerable and unable to proactively
        interact with people, then conversation keepaway is perfect,
        as long as you tightly control their 1&deg; social
        neighborhood.
        - this will also keep them emotionally pent up. they will be
          forced to bottle everything up and will have few people to
          talk to.
        - they will be eager to speak to anyone who listens, so
          therefore, they'll be more susceptible to toxic people who
          only pretend to listen at first.
        - they will remain socially needy. their energy will be
          effectively dispersed in small scale social interactions,
          leading to the development of fewer connections.

- this is especially effective if your goals include:
  - minimizing the scope of social information distribution
  - preventing the development of relationships, specific or general
  - disruption of relationship development
  - enticement of the subject/target into social settings with passive
    aggressive diffusion of their energy

### Decision Model Inference & Manipulation

- consider types of events where people widely share similar decision
  models. These decision model may have structural similarities that
  overlap and if enough people share the same model, it is easier to
  draw generalizations.
  - think of these decision models as representationally generated
    *flow charts* (yeh, assume it's automatic where AI builds a
    massive 4,000,000 node flowchart as the output for your decision
    model for buying a car)

  - before i start flinging around halfway-made-up terms like
    "component metatype", four examples for that in this context that
    are dead simple:
    1. Money
    1. Driver's License
      - if you don't have a driver's license, you can't drive without
    1. Car
        - if you don't have a car, you can't drive without internalizing
          other factors into your decision making calculus.
   1. Social Network (Physical/Logical Access, Connection and Energy to Project)
    risking legal consequences.

  - assume a bayesian network modeled as a DAG models these "decision
    model" and that the DAG's structure emerges from the product of
    some core graph `Gc`, along with the result of the total product
    of component metatypes.
    - e.g. `Gc (x) (C[1] (x) ... (x) C[m])`, where the tensor
      product is assumed to be effectively *associative* and *commutative*
      for the component metatypes
      - the tensor product constructs a morphism for any graph `g` that
        applies the structure changes for all of `C[1..m]`, producing
        graph `G`
  - for such a type of event, the regions overlapping among the most
    people should contain one of many component metatypes, where the
    presence of the metatype ensures that the DAG for the decision
    model will include specific motifs for that metatype component in
    it's structure.
  - since the DAG's define the structure of large bayesian networks,
    if you can ensure that some nodes are almost surely zero or one
    then:zaa
    - if you understand the underlying patterns in component metatypeszaza
      shared by many people, then seemingly insignificant information
      can sometimes clue you in to subtle inferences.
    - some of the most valuable inferences include those indicating
      which widely shared common decision model the person uses for
      that event type. or more generally, which common component
      metatypes compose a more unique decision model.

- it's a bayesian network and conditionals are used everywhere, but
  many of them strongly impact the resulting graph. These are like the
  nodes in an [expander
  graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph)
  - ugh i just typed this section to realize that expanders require
    connected graphs and bayesian DAG's can't be connected...
  -

#### Tangent on Expander Graphs

>  "Informally, a graph is a good expander if it has low degree and
>  high expansion parameters." - Wikipedia

  - in an armchair mathematician's terms, you're balancing these two
    things
    - these nodes are **maximally connected** as your `dN` neighborhood
      expands from `d = (0..n)` where `d := degrees`
    - however, in contrast, they are also **minimally connected** in
      that, as `dN` expands, the sum of `∑(|edges(dS)|)` is minimized,
      where `dS := |edges(boundary(dN))|` or the number of edges into
      of `dN`
  - the human brain seems to have elements of the concept of expander
    graph within it, as should any efficient information processing
    entity (or made efficient via nature)
    - this inference may also carry over to optimizing the efficiency
      of information representations, in which case, there are
      connections to DFA's, NFA's, etc, but for problems modeled as
      graphs with extreme complexity.

####

- wow i know jack shit about bayesian....
  - [correlate multinomial logistic regression and making inferences
    on a bayesian network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression
- for nodes in the bayesian graph whose result can be considered near
  certain within some `ε`, then assume these to be true/false and
  **properly** `sparsify` the DAG's matrix representation by setting
  all values above `(1 - ε)` and below `ε` to one and zero,
  respectively
  - this gives you an effective bayesian graph, assuming all the
    inferences you made held ... and that there's no cross correlation
    ... shit
  - you can still do this to `sparsify` the matrix for a bayesian DAG,
    but while you proceed through the bayesian network, you must
    ensure that you only prune inferences that reflect causative
    relationships
    - *and* that you either recompute or have some monoidal method for
      propagating changes through the bayesian network from the roots.
      - i.e. when you assume `p(a) < ε` and `p(b) > (1 - ε)`
        independently imply that `p(a) = 0` and `p(b) = 1` you
        should either:
        - recalculate entire the network or at least the effects on
          the next nodes
        - set `ε := (ε - p(a))` or similar for `p(b)` ... this isn't
          correct though.
        - propagate monoids through the network as inferences are made
          at each step that eventually evaluate in delayed fashion w/
          the logic that adjusts a "sparsified" bayesian DAG's weights
- for whatever process for "propagation of assumptions" is correct, it
  should be possible to iterate over the DAG from the roots, and the
  propagation should occur in a simplicial manner (where simplicial
  implies self-referential structure)

### Anyways...

- given a wide range of assumptions `a = 1, b = 1`, then a bayesian
  graph, in effect, should become more "sparse" and more "contracted"
  in the range of outcomes (moreso the range of combinations of
  outcomes)
  - probably some caveats here...

- the "goal" (in quotes because this is evil) if you want to confine
  someone by totally predicting their actions, then preemptively limit
  the "spread" of potential activations in the bayesian network
  - in other words, you want to expend the minimum energy to exert a
    maximal restriction on someone's options
    - when someone's options are severely limited then, their set of
      actions & responses is inherently limited. therefore the set of
      `p(e) for e in Events` becomes nearly zero and `sparsable (p(e)
      << ε) || (p(e) < ε)`

#### Inferences from Modes of Transportation

- so, if your target can only walk (not drive), their `p(x,y)` is
  strongly confined to their home.
  - some people find it easy to keep up with friends, but other people
    are tragic workaholics with aspergers.
    - some people have money to curry favor with friends (to
      compensate for social vulnerability and general cluelessness)
      and others made less than $7000 since sept 2014.
      - this implies the people who volunteer, exchange favors and are
        always around to help accumulate social currency
      - however, to those who can't drive, even volunteering can
        impose prohibitive barriers
    - etc... etc...

#### Inferences from Logical Understanding of Location

- there is a logical layer of locations `l in L := location`)
  - within ~2 miles or some reasonable distance from their home `h`.
  - the number of options varies depending on population density
  - if they can't easily arrange rides or public transit isn't
    available, then their most frequented locations will be mostly
    restricted to a subset of these options
    - this subset is also restricted by financial options, etc, etc
  - therefore, their `p(x,y)` is tightly coupled to
    - `p(h) || p(l[1]) || ... || p(l[n])`
    - viz. this person will almost certainly be found in one of these
      locations. if it's really that bad for the target, you almost
      don't even need GPS or the NSA.
      - you *know* where they're going to go because they can't travel
        go anywhere else or afford to do anything.
  - the point is to render your target as predictable as possible by
    ruthlessly eliminating every possible option -- *methodically,
    mathematically and with tactical precision* -- without raising
    their suspicion and triggering a change in their behavior.

#### Inferences from disposable income

- your target only has `k` in disposable income every month. this
  further limits their options. if they make below a certain income,
  it can be assumed that the target cannot save money and thus has
  none saved.
  - if the target is cut of from social connections/social
    interactions then, this preemptively robs them of any
    opportunities they might discover through interactions with sets
    of 1º and 2º connections.

#### Inferences from Other Social Metrics

- 1-degree and 2-degree neighborhood size
- variety in connections and interactions
- volume in connections

- flux of interactions emerging on the IRL social graph
  - some nodes in the social graph exert more "gravity" for pulling in
    interactions.








### Using Social Physics to Contain/Promote People and Ideas

- sociophysical "jails" or "manacles"
  - ok, probably don't actualy use the term manacles.
    - but the point of these sociophysical tactics for social
      engineering is to make it "painful" to "move" in a sociophysical
      sense, until you comply.
    - it's like a horrible pyramid scheme crossed with
      [Milgram's Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment)
      - it plays out IRL, in any digital realm you enter, on any
        social media site.
      - there is nothing you can do and the NSA apparently facilitates
        all of this horribly dark shit with ZERO oversight from our
        leaders and ZERO accountability
        - there is literally ZERO understanding of the techniques the
          NSA is using, so there can be no accountability because our
          leaders simply do not know what questions to ask
        - nothing brings you more pain than asking these questions

### Psychiatry (probably re/move this section)

- the western conceptualization of the mind is utterly flawed and the
  materialistic understanding is making americans sick on a massive
  scale, where the easy, cheap treatment for insurance to cover is
  medication. (pull this into a separate article?)
  - the problem is, the chemical imbalance theory in somehwere b/w
    20-80% of cases of moderate mental illness causes psychiatrists in
    particular to treat a totally fallacious cause
    - because the actual root cause is not treated (*the information
      attributed to the patient that is distributed among people in
      their social network*), it's like treating cancer with placebo
      sugar. medication in many cases does nothing, if not exacerbates
      mental illness.
      - this statement will be received controversially, but
        information has a life of its own in sociophysical
        networks.
        - it is difficult/impossible to quanity/assess the
          information, but therapy can help encourage dialogue
        - also, it's not healthy for people to assume the problem lies
          elsewhere... individuals have no control over what other
          people are thinking.
        - however, information injected into sociophysical networks
          literally has a life of its own and once its diffused into
          people's minds, it is almost certainly there forever or
          until each social connection decides to overlook it, (which
          often requires communiction and demonstration of changed
          habits, etc => to each individual the information has
          diffused into)
        - by "information has a life of it's own" i mean these are
          !@#$'ing probabilistic programs that self-replicate
          information
          - usually sophys networks/dynamics are intractibly complex
            that information overload causes most of your social
            connections to be so innundated with details relevant to
            their own life, that they don't necessarily frame their
            interactions based on problematic information attributed
            to your identity.
          - the best way to address these situations is through
            communication. however, similar to how tweet storms ravage
            the social media landscape with self-replicating
            information, so do sophys. information programs
          - this goes right back to the article that i wrote about
            chaotic programming, which is a paradigm that describes
            genetics, human cognition and the dynamics of information
            in social networks.
      - if the medical establishment ever gave me the time of day,
        they would ridicule my arguments here. but this conception of
        sociphysical vectors for mental illess is irrefutable
        - *the chemical imbalance theory will be _destroyed_ by
          computational medicene by 2030* and at that time, the tables
          will be turned and the truth will be set free: the chemical
          imbalance theory is only a primary factor in a minority of
          mental illness.
        - once people realize what they've paying out their ass for a
          sham and sedating themselves with (occasionally) useless
          psychatric medication, they will be furious
    - ok, given some assumptions that, by 2030:
      - for approx 20% of patients w/ mild-to-moderate mental illness,
        comp. medicine will *CONCLUSIVELY, IRREFUTABLY* prove that any
        amount of medication was inappropriate for these patients (the
        assumption is that certainly, any meds were wrong, & therefore
        unnecessarily altered epigenetic expression in the brains of
        patients, therefore *giving* them mild chemical imbalances)
      - and assume that, for another 20-60% of other patients w/
        mild-to-moderate mental illness, medicine ....

### Intentional

- propagation of mental illness
  - from parents to child (it's really a situation where there is
    diminished propagation of information to build traits needed for
    early/adolescent developmental ish.)
    - so, not actually propagation of the illness, but if it happens,
      it can result from constrained variety of experience or reduced
      permeability b/w parent/child
      - so, it's transmission of habits, etc.

### Muting A Target's Identity

- ![Neo Matrix]()

- turn down volume of someone by refusing to refer to their
  name/identity. the more their name, their identity or details
  related to life are referenced, the more that those details diffuse
  into the sociophysical environment
  - as in Voldemort, "he who should not be named"
  - this has many effects, including driving someone crazy, who is
    always referred to in the 4th person or as a "ghost"
  - this artificially reduces any sociophysical signal related to
    their identity and prevents others from perpetuating it.
  - once the person is no longer around, very little memory or residue
    remains of their existence.
    - DEATH OF A SALESMAN
  - taken to the extreme, this person is a living ghost and simply
    haunts from one place to another, where people who happen to see
    them have to deal with what is in front of their eyes, but never
    authentically try to interact or develop a relationship
    - if you are this person, you'll notice how fast people try to
      shut down or redirect conversations you want to have. this is
      because they don't want other people to retain positive memory
      of you or anything you are interested in.
    - if you have aspergers or other issues where you lack strong
      social skills, you'd never know what it's like to live a normal
      life. you'd simply never know the difference. this is my life.

- say what you will, but this simply optimizes sociophysical ideas:
  number of references to you, rate/quality of new social connections,
  rate/quality of social interactions, depth of conversation, etc.

### Isolation of Social Graph Boundaries

- The physical or graph boundaries of someone's social network can be
  identified, as well as nodes & regions of it that are more widely
  connected.
  - Boundaries and local connectedness are ideas that are widely
    studied in graph theory.
  - Information is viral and causes people to react differently. Some
    people are loud, others are quiet. Most everyone acts to bring
    about some understanding of what is "good" and by framing
    information in those terms, it can be presented in such a way to
    subtly cue the person to action.
  - Most everyone that acts righteously feels good about what they do.
  - So if you suggest information to highly connected, nodes on the
    boundaries of someone's social network, it leads adjacent nodes to
    move further away from the person and become less connected in
    general.
  - Life is full of flux in the social structure. People move away,
    start families and there are many other events which change the
    social graph. People gravitate towards the areas of their social
    graph where the social connections were reinforced.
    - The person who does not or can not both gradually grow new
      strong connections or reinforce existing social connections will
      end up isolating themselves, if this goes on long enough.
    - by injecting information into someone's graph that increases
      resistence of new connection, disrupts existing connections or
      forces most social interactions to be lensed through a negative
      frame, you can isolate someone. In most circumstances, this does
      not happen because one person simply cannot exert that much
      influence over the boundary of someone's social network.

  - however, if you end up social isolated, it can be very difficult
    to build new connections.
    - this depends on many factors, including how widely information
      has been disseminated that alters the implicit frame someone's
      social interactions.
      - for example, celebrity defamed by scandal can have a VERY
        difficult time building their network back. Since information
        is viral, its effects are multiplicative, including how it
        poisons the frame. people in these social circles gravitate
        towards where they anticipate that influence *will* be, not
        where it is and certainly not where it was.

### Use of Fear/Love to Contract/Expand A Target's Social Boundaries

- projection of fear enables these people to use their energy more
  efficiently.
  - non-physical pain is harder to define, but people move away from
    it just like they do when they experience its physical counterpart.
  - for the people in a 1-degree and 2-degree social neighborhood (IRL
    or virtual) -- i.e. their social boundary -- if you
    project/condition fear of the target, most people will move away
    from him/her, especially if they do not feel strong to face that
    fear themselves.
  - since the fear is non-physical, harder to define and its quality
    is multifarious, people trying to contain a target can invoke in
    the social boundary members at least one compelling reason to stay
    away from the target
  - if you successfully motivate through fear, then the individuals in
    the social boundary will become conditioned and even spread that
    fear amongst themselves.
    - they become vectors for disseminating your will/animus and
      malice towards the target.
    - at this point, not only is it unnecessary to waste your energy
      incurring liability to inflict pain on the target and his/her
      social boundary, you don't have to waste energy to spread this
      information because, as a self-perpetuating sociophyisical
      dynamic, it becomes effectively autonomous.

- however, there are individuals who do not fear. they do not fear
  specific things or, foolishly, they do not fear anything.
  - to me, it is more important that no one ever be successful when
    the tactics above are used unjustly and/or with malice. this is
    something more important to me to act against completely,
    successful and early than my own safety.
  - also, i am the kind of person who becomes curious, when they are
    presented with something they know they should fear. I want to
    know why i fear it and, as a general tactic to undermining it if I
    find it is something I believe is unjust, a sign of malicious
    intent or someone neutral acting under the influence of
    manipulation, then i actually want to get closer to the thing I
    fear.
    - this is also why some investigative techniques can be abused on
      me in order to make the claim that I was trying to get close to
      something illegal/immoral/terrorist/etc.
      - someone with enough legal/investigative/psychological
        experience would certainly know they could abuse my simple,
        foolish reactions to draw me closer to say i wanted to be part
        of something, when truly i never understood anything that was
        going on.
  - not only do i fear nothing, i have nothing left to lose except my
    personal sense of dignity/honor/etc.

### Don't Become Big Enough To Be A Target, Work Indirectly And Disdain Ego

- just to be clear. i hate almost everything i'm writing about here.
  - to understand it, to fight it and to contain it, i have immersed
    myself in understand it and everything that happened to me.
- in the utilitarian, pragmatic manipulation of social networks, it is
  important to establish your network as a kind of power broker for
  financial/social influencer. you don't want to be nominally known as
  such a gatekeeper at all.
  - in fact, you'd very much like for someone close to you or under
    your influence to be known as the person with power. people with
    social/financial power are magnetic: for those that don't have
    power, magnates can make your dreams reality or, at least, that is
    what those without power are drawn to believe.
  - furthermore, if you are knowingly concerting machiavellian
    mechanations to drive or influence events close your networks, do
    you want that attention and allure that comes along with being
    someone known to have power?
    - no, it is very likely that person will become the fallguy
      - or at least, their magnetic pull as being known as powerful
        will absorb some of the karmic consequences of mechinations
        that become known.
  - but if you are practicing these utilitarian, amoral tactics
    pragmatically, you can lens the energy of people in your networks
    by leveraging social/financial opportunities as a power broker
    - beware, much of this could be construed as illegal, immoral, etc
      and can result in legitimate corruption cases
    - these opportunities become a kind of resource for you, but it is
      a limited resource with quantity that is difficult to define
    - so, for these people, it is preferable to to identiy those who
      can be deceived, manipulated, pressured to downgrade their
      (negotiation requirements), or -- best of all -- can be given an
      opportunity that will fail fast, fail pleasantly, or fail in
      some way that will enable you to respond advantegeously
      - in this last case, you have legitimately done something for
        them. however, this is essentially setting someone up for
        failure. it is because this is difficult/expensive for upper
        management to diagnose that this is a cardinal sin of busines
        and management.
      - but, life has various sets of rules which only apply in
        certain contexts. if you are not in corporation, corporate
        policy does not apply to you. society's laws always apply to
        you, but what matters in society is belief, perceived belief
        networks and the ability to multiply your influence through
        those things
        - so, someone who is operating as a kind of shadow broker for
          power/influence will find this as an alluring pathway to
          appear to do a favor for someone while truthfully throwing
          them under the bus

  - my fear is that local extensions of homeland security, domestic
    intelligence networks, and etc are beginning to operate to
    dominate regional influence simply towards the attainment of that
    end in itself, for itself. pragmatically, it is easy for them to
    justify both this and total secrecy in everything they do by
    claiming it is for current or future national security, when
    foremost, it is extortion, coercion, racketeering and exactly the
    same as everything else the mafia does.
    - domestic criminal networks may also be adapting to this era of
      technology, social media, illicit surveillance, etc, finding it
      all very convenient towards control, illusion and elusion.

### Limiting/Providing Financial/Social Capital & Options

- financial capital and social capital are exchangable resources.
  - a clever person can exchange financial capital for social capital
    and vice versa, using social capital to multiply their influence
    or identify new opportunities.

  - if you find yourself isolated, you are vulnerable. Depending on
    personality traits, social (potential) and financial capital. it
    can be far more challenging for you to rebound than it is for a
    small group of sycophantic people to indirectly keep you there,
    without ever appearing to have lifted a finger.

  - when your financial capital is limited, you have few options, you
    are strained and this makes you very predictable. when you're
    social behavior is predictable, this means you invest in social
    expansion in a limited number of ways. this makes you more easily
    blocked, especially in the age of social media, where people who
    want to promote themselves post everything online.
    - this kind of indirect coordination is not natural social
      behavior. it doesn't emerge in social groups who have primarily
      individual concerns or simply care about those close to them.
    - this kind of group behavior can be coordinated, kind of like
      someone decided to make sociopathy a team sport.
    - one way this can happen is if a handful of people inject the
      right information into the few circumstances where you try to
      socially expand to compel judgemental, exclusionary behavior
      from neural people. several people can indirectly work through
      others and manipulate what is otherwise natural behavior.
    - i think this is what they call "scientology". however, it's
      strange that a religion based on freeing you from information
      forms known as thetans would also project those same negative
      information forms into your life, but i suppose they just hoping
      you'll develop stockholm syndrome and will pay them to help
      "clean" it up later.
    - if you think this is wrong, i can explain their training
      materials, pattern languages and obsession over "disconnection"
      *THIS IS DISCONNECTION*, by the way.

### When targets are muted and/or isolated, adversaries have major advantages in amplifying information (to establish it as a baseline)

- if you are isolated for months, ...
  - if you are muted and other people can't talk about you or your
    life events, it means that adversaries can project & amplify their
    own signal in neighborhoods of your social network
  - their narrative becomes dominant and you will always be reacting
    to it (...)
    - the signal of your personal account will always be (nearly
      insignificant) if some group of people can actually pull this
      off
    - if a group of people did this to you, you can be sure that they
      will listen for & react to your diminished signal, while
      continuing to amplify their own and walling you into a very
      small set of social connections
      - you won't be able to expand (...)


# (Implications of (your perspective on) Social Physics, Networks and Information Dynamics)

- possibly remove
- why attempting to quantify information structure/dynamics/diffusion,
  along with sociophysical models and game theory leads to deep
  philosophical conclusions about the significance/nature of
  information.
  - if you don't understand what i'm writing about, then it's easy to
    assume that a worldview based on a subjective-but-passionate
    understanding of some ideology (i.e. humanism or marxism) is
    sufficient for dictating or restraining policy.
  - if you don't understand this content (and it isn't easy) then you
    don't actually understand enough about life, society and, in
    particular, human behavior to predict how policy will affect
    people.
    - if your a passionate humanist and your goal is to help people,
      wouldn't it be useful to understand people, group dynamics, game
      theory to inform your political views?
    - if it's important to you to actually achieve the lofty goals and
      ideals that drive your passion, then you absolutely have to
      understand this subject, otherwise you are forever at a
      disadvantage, unware that you are a piece in someone else's
      game, a leaf blowing about in a windstorm.
- you might be a well-reasoned person living in a land of milk and
  honey who wishes for only the alleviation of human suffering, but
  the world is not full of sunshine and rainbows. life is a game and
  there are many players.
  - if your values and ideals are worth hard work and sacrifice to
    attain, then you have to understand how the other players in this
    game will react to you.
