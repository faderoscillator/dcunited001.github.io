### Oneiroism

should include a growth limiting mechanism
- as in, no offical structure or *huge* focus on lots of money/power

### [Discordianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism)

- similar to discordianism in its open source feel with a focus on literature
- [Principia Discordia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Discordia)

The world, as seen through the eyes of the innocent, is perhaps...

Conley - I think I'd largely agree with your assessment of the
trajectory of religion and foundations. The problem is that replacing
one shifting foundation with another is no real solution. A religion
that is going to give real answers can't be subjective
(e.g. crowd-sourced).

DC - yeh, i feel like we're going to see a return to religion precisely
because of science's rapid redevelopment of belief structures. it
somewhat refutes Nietzsche because though science has driven us away
from faith (God is dead), but now we'll see a return of the need for
these foundational belief systems (thus, God is not dead)

I'm not sure if I am going all the way with that. However, we're
seeing the effects of this demoralization all around us and if we fail
to diagnose the root of these problems, we'll never get anywhere...

I hardly seem like the person who would argue for this, but sometimes
I think I'm the perfect person to advocate for a return to religion
because I am not dedicated to any particular religion myself. That
gives me unique positioning & footing in regard to the subject.

also, the idea for the crowd-sourced component is that, by having
someone focus on creating their own story, you give someone a goal of
meditating and focusing intently on what that thing means to
them. their version of an open-source myth on love is really a
long-term meditation on the concept of love. the idea is to get people
to imagine what it is like, what it feels like to have that
experience.

furthermore, this is in spite of and in contrast to recent cultural
trends where we are becoming "less human" through rapid cultural
evolution. these trends include encroaching nihilism (which is our
greatest enemy in the 21st century) and the sublimation of
individuality, whereby it becomes impossible to distinguish oneself.

so, in this way, someone's version of an open source myth is not only
a meditation to cultivate these ideas (of love, heroicism, etc) but
also it's an exercise to strengthen individuality and purpose to
retain these human cultural elements in spite of these depressing
cultural trends.

- so basically, if telling these stories is part of the tradition of
  some belief system (that is, it's ritualized story creation)
  - this is an act of meditation on very important concepts in a way
    that becomes an exercise to strengthen ourselves against
    encroaching nihilism
  - by attaching a quasi-religious significance to this traditional,
    ritualistic act of identifying ones own stories that embody
    specific ideals, it provides a source of meaning that emboldens
    one against nihilism and strengthens us against the loss of
    individuality.
    - it is YOUR STORY. it's your implementation of the myth. you can
      start from the seed, which contains the fixpoints for that
      episaga, or you can add/remove what you will. however, you can
      also fork someone else's version of an episaga or help them
      contribute to it.
- this idea adds onto the ideas from Epistemology, Cognition &
  Category Theory in that we are strengthening some of the most
  important skills humanity posseses. and we have given ourselves the
  perfect excuse for doing so, in spite of the futility of standing
  against nihilism. (maybe shuffle order around)
