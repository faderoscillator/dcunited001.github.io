# Blog Ideas:


## IRL applications of social physics

- civic planning
- sociophysical minimization of traffic congestion for urban centers
  - for example, via suggested variation in working hours. tax
    deductions for the businesses that comply with slightly variated
    business hours
    - this specific idea for traffic minimization is perfect for major
      urban centers with huge problems w/ traffic
  - other ideas include traffic routing patterns, so that traffic is
    coaxed into into "perferated" bundles of cars that are like
    traffic packets, that can be routed more efficiently.
    - i originally had this idea in 2008. by modulating traffic light
      green/red time length, you coax certain quanta/waves of traffic
      to become clumped together, ideally minimizing the travel time
      and feul consumption time of everyone on the road.
      - very difficult to prove the application of this technique
        would be effective though. and, since it's augmented by
        hooking into Google/Waze/Uber/etc navigation and destinations,
        there might be some privacy concerns

## The Basics & Why It's Personally Relevant

- particle physics crossed with graph theory
  - with biophysics-like state-machines, with idealized particles and
    less-complex physical state
- social physics is like a (macrocosm) of biophysics

## Discussion of Schematic Complexity

- complexity of information crossed with type theory
- social physics simulations are rooted in particle physics w/ shared
  fields
  - the interactions in the physical space are dependent on n-D
    primary virtual space(s)
    - as well as combinatorially enumerated secondary virtual spaces
      which emerge
  - these virtual spaces can be parameterized with continuous or
    discrete variables
    - from which all the classic types of topological spaces emerge
- on the other end, the physical spaces (the "real" spaces) can
  provide for various particle behaviors and behavior types -
- this is the most complex intersection of infinities in every way I
  can conceive -
- it's the most complext application of applied pure math that I have
  yet imagined
  - but social physics is all mostly based on work done in the 19th
    century
- and yet, we all navigate this mathematically intractible maze with
  the same 3-pound slab of smart-meat
  - some of us are profoundly terrible at it.
  - a few operate methodically, including both sociopaths and empaths,
    balancing opportunity cost to empower themselves or others
  - Most of us meerkats are as adept as our range and sum of
    experience. This category operates socially without significant
    conscious effort, which implies several:
    - (1) They have one to five prior years of constant/regular social
      experience with few total or involuntary interruptions,
      regardless of whether it's positive or negative
    - (2) They have a wide variety of types of experiences
    - (3) They have a strong degree of choice in social experience,
      which requires and produces social independence
    - (4) They haven't been unhappy in their lives long enough to wonder
      why they can't get it together.
    - (5) When they have the kinds of problems almost everyone does,
      they have enough of the right social capital or psychological
      flexibility to adjust before they become socially isolated or
      financially disabled.

#### Social (behaviors/tactics to act/respond) are accumalated through conditioning

- most of us lack a rigid framework: we subconsciously operate
  emotionally-driven and neurally-connected statistical models
    - basically cross graph theory, markov models & state machines
    - behavior and state-changes driven by:
      - (1) rules whose rigidity ranges from diamond to steel to paper
      or plastic.
      - (2) information, confidence of information, distribution of
        information
      - (3) individual and collective objectives, needs, wants,
        resources and options


### Distribution of Agency & Will (Animus)

- the dynamics of physical/informational interactions of agents/nodes
  in graphs: social/physical/financial/etc
  - lots more to explore here

### Power and Mitigating Counter-Ancipitory Effects in One's Environment

- Dr Strange has a high focus on and a high density of
  counter-anticipitory effects
  - this is true, visually, semantically and in-terms
  - it's almost a story where, in terms of plot, time itself is
    rearranging itself, even though the movie is perceived linearly

> Beyond Time, Beyond Death...

where there are aspects of the metaphysical that transcend time and a
living agent's capacity to project change into the metaphysical beyond
their own subjective demise is perhaps the greatest power.

# Social Physics Simulation Ideas

[for a 2-force simulation, where one force operates with orientation](https://peeterjoot.wordpress.com/2009/12/08/jacobians-and-spherical-polar-gradient/)

#### cocktail party simulation

  - 100-1000 particles form molecule "conversations"
  - two fields and simple particle physics determine particle movement
  - no exchange of information

#### bar simulation

  - build on cocktail party simulation
  - particles are of a single type
  - variations: add money, add gender

#### colorshifting FFT (not really social physics)

- each particle has a colorshifting function, which takes its
  - beach FFT segment amplitude determines the mass/speed or field
    reactivity of the particle
  - so red particles move fast, blue particles move slow and FFT
    partially determines the amount of movement for each particle
    - as well as field interactions

#### marijuana dealing simulation

  -


#### Viral Nature of Language

- 100 simple particles, each with a dictionary of 100 english nouns
  mapped to integers

  - each time a connection is forged, they exchange:
    - their copy of that dictionary
  - connected via graph constructed by delauney triangulation


#### Cymatic Particle Shader

- model the distribution of waves through a 2D lattice of connected
  particles.
  - stream audio into some points and model waves as they propagate
    through the lattice, without losing information
  - model the wave transmission in a similar way to conway's game of
    life.

### Measuring Configurational & Conformational Entropy in Social Physics

- instead of measuring Thermal Entropy via "Course Graining" of q[i] &
  p[i] (according to wikipedia)
  - and dilineating the eexpected/actual distro's with the ideal...

- instead, these are simulations to study the sociophysical
  "molecular" distributions found in configuration space after a
  simulation runs.
  - in particular, identify the total time summed for each molecule
    type ... and hopefully specific combinations of particles by ID,
    but those calculations will be mostly intractable after a few
    dozen particles
  - how do these typologies of connected social particles become more
    and less prevalent over time?
    - I'm not sure if this question can be answered. it is possible,
      if you're simply measuring the types of particles that
      emerge. not particle ID combinations.
    - even still, it will require storing large aggregate textures
      over time

- this requires the standard social physical particle system
  determined by at least 2 forces upon which higher order, graph
  mediated connections accrue
  - the graph is the product of particle positions and is formed when
    node's attractive forces overlap, stabalizing against the
    repulsive forces. this is similar to electronegativity and the
    strong positive charge at the center of molecules
    - the attractive force is better understood as a field of vision
      and it's not the field that directly affects particles, but the
      area of space which directs a higher density of particle
      "attention"
      - this itself forms a field, which triggers higher-level actions
        in the particles. this field of attention is a secondary field
        over which the force can transfer energy
      - (move this summary up to the initial description of this type
        of simulation)

  - attractive field maxima are identified and these centroids are
    estimated to be the center of molecules.
    - the centroids can be pulled out with a cheap knockoff of
      thrust's scan() method.
    - these centroids are through into memory as vertices for delauney
      triangulation, along with the rest of the particles.
    - from here, a graph can be constructed in matrix form
      - if the indices of the maxima are retained, you can walk
        outward one degree from the centroids with the CPU
        - (under assumptions in the physical behavior of nodes,
          e.g. stability)

- the result is that you get subgraphs with a very finite set of
  possible molecule, 2 through 7 particles at most arranged in circles
  - you can use these subgraphs to add the frametime of each
    configuration-type to it's bin in the accumulating texture
    - the molecules are only speciated into types by their subgraph
      edges in a molecule, not by their orientation in space.
    - for particle simulations with a single particle type, only 6 or
      7 molecule types will emerge.
      - for simulations with multiple particle types, there are more
        types that can be formed.
  - the values in the accumulating texture are related to the
    probability distribution for seeing these molecules in the social
    physics simulation, or may actually be

- from here, entropy can be calculated for the distribution of
  molecule arrangements in time.
  - all of the following will change the distribution for types of
    molecules that emerge:
    - different particle types and rules for their interactions
    - particle interactions are defined by particle state & state
      changes
  - given that you know the inherent variations in particle attributes
    that contribute towards their action/interactions, there should be
    some "normalness" in the distribution of combinations/subgraphs &
    their qualities

- amoung simulations with a lower particle to particle-type ratio,
  properly defined rules and balanced values should result in higher
  entropy values.
  - balancing these equaations and forces seems difficult. the best
    way to do it is a combination of a numerical approach and an
    automated approach.
  - numerically, you can identify values of rForce & aForce that
    result in a net force of zero that hold particles in place
    - this must be done carefully and so that it works for all
      two-to-seven particle molecule AND for all clusterings of
      particles that don't quite meet the definition of a molecule
    - this utilizes the lagrangian, i think
    - numerically tuned values can give you a consistent basis each
      amoung the rForce & aForce, which will be important.
    - the basis has to be set up to scale properly to different screen
      resolutions, which is something that i messed up recently
