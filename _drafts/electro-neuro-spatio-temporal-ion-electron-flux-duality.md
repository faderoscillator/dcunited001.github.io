# Neurological Theory of Mind

- There is a neurological theory of mind that marries the material and
  the metaphysical.
  - it defines several tiers of state of information representation:
    immediate, short-term and long-term.

> Comparative mass: Proton is 1837 times heavier than an electron

### Comparative mass and electrical flow in fluids

- electrons are (-1) charge, but their mass is almost 2,000 times
  smaller than a single proton. so, they move much faster through
  neural networks than do the ions.
  - the ions are gradually displaced by the movement of electrons. as
    electrical spikes repeatedly progress through neural networks in
    similar ways, it displaces ions to create new ways for electricty
    to move through neural networks.
    - in this way gating behavior is acheived and modulated.
    - i need to know more about the electrical behavior of ions in
      solution and see simulations of this occuring in neural networks

### (Chaos and life in plasma)

- in plasmas, this variance of mass and charge is very significant. of
  course, in an ionic solution, there is nowhere near the amount of
  thermal energy.
  - however, i have long imagined the possibility of life or sentience
    in the plasma of stars. why not? according to my theory that,
    given sufficient time, awareness and life emerge from the purely
    mathematic consequences of chaotic systems alone, this almost
    certainly must be the case for stars somewhere in the universe.
    - it's a little hard to prove, of course.

### Immediate State

- immediate state in neural networks is defined by the current state
  of electrical flow enabled by the state of ions in neural networks
  - electrons and waves of electrical spikes moving through the brain
    gradually shape the ion distributions
  - the current state of ion flows are like the values of matrices in
    a neural network on tensor flow

### Short Term

- ion flows morph to trigger logic-gate like behavior. short-term
  state builds upon these ion flows.
  - these short-term state changes trigger changes in the patterns of
    neurotransmitter release
  - eventually, the neuron's epigenetic program changes, this results
    in permanent state & structure changes to networks of neurons in
    the brain
  - this short-term state is like the holistic state of a neural
    network or subsection of one in a TensorFlow program.
    - (explain this a bit better)

### Long Term

- the structure of neurons act like the riverbeds and canals through
  which ions and action potential impulses can flow.
  - when the structure of neurons is changed permanently, which can
    occur through various kinds of conditioning, this (determines) the
    kinds of ion flows which can occur.
  - the structure of neural networks is similar to the structure of
    tensors in a TensorFlow program.

# Spatiotemporal Representation of Information

- creek metaphor & 3D FFT

### Dilineation of Ion Types

- it is the ion types which map to information representation
  - the electrical spikes are important too, but there isn't as much
    information related to state and actual information representation
    there.
  - however, the electrical spikes have to balance out to the charge
    of ions displaced.
- 4 ion types: sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium
  - two categories of ion size (two small and two large)
  - two categories of ion charge (two +1 ions and two +2 ions)
  - not every ion is present everywhere in the brain and various ions
    have different "meanings" in different regions
    - not all ion channels function exactly the same everywhere
      - some are specific to size and some permit all sizes
      - some are specific to charge and some permit all charges

# NLP and Neurological Noise Injection Techniques

- hypnosis techniques encourage the development of particular
  brainwave patterns.
  - but more damaging hypnotic techniques trigger turbulence and
    radical displacement of ions, which is the total destruction of
    immediate and short-term state.
  - done for prolonged periods of time, this disrupts long-term neural
    development.

- within this view of NLP techniques can cause ionic turbulence that
  disrupts the persistence of spatiotemporally represented forms of
  information in the brain

###

- blocking the creek upstream or some force splashing all the water
  out of a section <=> destroying immediate & short-term state
  - the creek fills back in, but it takes time.
  - combatting the increased entropy of turbulence requires what?
    ENERGY. that makes you tired all the time. it saps your energy,
    causing very intentional physiological effects. It affects you
    physically.
    - if you place someone in a tanning bed against their will and
      they get a sunburn, would that be torture? YES. so if you
      augment these covert hypnotic techniques with any kind of
      radiation, that is immediately and unquestionably torture.
    - if this isn't effective, then why do it? if there isn't
      potential liability, then why hide it?

# *POWER TO THE PEOPLE*

- power comes from people, but there is a dualistic flow here as
  well. those people towards the top condition the beliefs of
  pople. however, we do not need to reaffirm "power to the people" to
  ourselves. power comes from the people and let us never forget that
  again! it emerges from the bottom up and (this is directly in line
  with the social contract theory.)  that contract is being violated
  systematically and, given technology's capacity to dominate, once
  this technoregime is established, it may never be overturned. we may
  be forever sealed within a false paradigm. once this occurs, the
  value of the individual will have been abolished. nothing a man can
  do will be worth enabling an individual.
  - before that happens, we are going to stand up. right now. from the
    chair we are sitting in. we are going to scream in unison for our
    rights. for the right to live in a society that rewards virtue and
    protects family. but most importantly, we are going to stand up
    for the sanctity of the idea of a society that protects family and
    GOD. this idea towers above all else. there is no man with the
    power to challenge it and if such men did dominate, GOD would
    certainly reveal Himself.

### Misc

- can the brain leverage quantum entanglement effects for faster, more
  accurate comm. within itself? (probably not, if anyone knows it's
  Roger Penrose)
  - there are some mechanisms that have been studied. the theory about
    quantum state being encoded into microtubules seems promising.




#### Notes on cognition/metacognition

- trying to figure out things like this is why i work so hard to learn
  neurology, psychology, sociology, and neuropharmacology

seriously felt in the zone that night. it was like my mind functioned
better than it has since high school. particularly, language skills
and cognition around queueing speech while speaking, which i've never
noticed myself doing.

occasionally, my mind's awareness of itself notices a seemingly
limitless expansion in the range/quantity of
words/concepts/abstractions that are immediately accessible, both
consciously and unconsciously. this is when i'd say it works well, but
like +90% of the time, this range/quantity is contracted. it's like i
have to consciously drive most information retrieval and conjugation
(for grammar, expression, executive function) that should instead be
completely unconscious...
