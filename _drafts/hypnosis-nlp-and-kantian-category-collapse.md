- there's already a ton of study on meditative states of mind, but i
  believe this provides a neuroanatomical basis for more mystical or
  spirital concepts like prana, kundalini and "energy" flows
  - but it seems that controlling/channeling the flow of spinal,
    cranial and cognitive neural impulses can cause altered flows of
    information/energy within the nervous system that would otherwise
    be rare.
  - e.g. diminished flow via efferent nerves may cause the brain/mind
    to tune into input from afferent nerves.
  - e.g. diminished flow in the DMN and brain regions active in
    cognitive may trigger decentralized crosstalk b/w neurons

# What is NLP?

    NLP terms (interesting bc inaccessible. turns out to be good)

### Modalities/Submodalities

- [submodalities](https://www.nlpworld.co.uk/nlp-glossary/s/submodalities/)

- hacking sensory inputs.
  - particularly, those related to the "lizard brain"
    - mimicking sensory input effectively triggers to unconsciously
      trigger signals deeper within the brain

- tonal system
  - using emotional tones of voice/action to signal:
    - in phase with the expected response,
    - randomly, against expectation
    - neutrally
    - counter to the specifically expected emotional response
    - with some pattern of behavior designed to "fake out" the
      counter-party's [n-gram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram)
      - an N-gram is the next N moves you predict the counter-party to
        make. for NLP (natural language processing), it is the next N
        words you expect someone to say.
      - it's used on the iPhone to suggest words, given a partial seq
      - but it's the sequence of symbols representing the next moves
        you expect an adversary to make
        - if you sufficiently generalize this concept, you can apply
          it in a cold, cruel, utilitarian way that would give stalin
          a boner by manipulating your counter-party's sequence of
          emotions/actions/etc
        - remember, you naturally win because you gain/maintain their
          trust while drawing out their desire to want/need a
          connection,
          - yada yada yada.
          - excuse me while i fucking barf.
      - SCIENTOLOGY LITERALLY IS TEAM SOCIOPATHY

  - when you decouple your emotional state by composing patterns of
    the above in response to the natural emotional states of others,
    it forces them to be reactive
    - this is an abuse of an authentic social connection. most people
      want to be in phase with you, but you can alter your behavior to
      consistently give yourself an advantage by exploiting the
      needs/desires of others to feel an authentic emotional
      connection
      - in a cold, utilitarian way, this usually gives you the upper
        hand.
      - i never do this on purpose; i simply lack the ability to form
        emotional connection via like 8 different personality
        complexes, including an attachment disorder

# Hypnosis, NLP and Conceptual Designation

During the mind's infancy, there is a state of tabula rasa, but
parents have focused love, nutrition, intent and planning into the
child for nine months or longer already. Anything is possible, but the
brain's structure already exists.

- beginning life as tabula rasa
  - accumulation of residue
  - elimination of this residue
    - first, you need to be aware of this residue's presence
    - you have to stimulate these buttons being pressed
      - and gradually condition alternative reponses to be stronger
      - however, the risk is that triggering these stimuli makes the
        unwanted responses even stronger.
  - remapping the residue

### Conditioning of Conceptual Designation Leads to a Distracted Mind

  - also, people who i feel like used hypnotis or NLP techniques,
    would condition me with stimuli that distracted my focus and
    layered meaning onto stimuli.
    - (this is like layering in emphasis onto stimuli and conditioning
      the mind to divert its energy in particular ways)
    - if they actually were doing this, they could then trigger my
      cognitive processes to react to specific imagery and types of
      sensory experience.
    - they could cause my mind to change the quality of cognitive
      activities. it causes your mind to be triggered into utilizing
      different neurological modalities (a term which NLP references
      heavily)
    - it can be incredibly distracting, especially if you have ADD or
      aspergers
    - for example, in context of the expression "he pushed my
      buttons", NLP is like how you create those buttons.
      - you can then subtly trigger someone to begin thinking about
        specific imagery or trigger brief emotional states that the
        person becomes more likely to re-express in the short-term
    - if so, it's interesting how these techniques are kind of like
      *the opposite* of gradually shedding conceptual designation in
      that they condition you to create artificial constructs
    - and if someone did this intentionlly and surreptitiously, this
      seems a bit ... mean. and like not just mean. it seems like
      something you might see in a silence of the lambs movie. like
      something the serial killer character could and would do to
      people.
      - and it requires so much forethought, plenty of regular contact
        with the subject/target, and *constant* focus on the malicious
        intent of bringing harm to that person.
      - "Anthony Hopkins uses NLP to butter his victims up. Be like
        Hopkins"

### Hypnosis Accelerates Deposition of Residual Potential for Conceptual Designation

- The [monkey mind]()

- the story in "Isis Unveiled" about someone walking along, who freaks
  out seeing snake on the road, but on closer inspection, it's just a
  stick lying in the road.
  - this is about the tendency of the unconscious and subconscious
    elements of the human mind to misclassify input, without enough
    information.

  - when you deprive people of social signal or sensory signal, it can
    cause these same unconscious & subconscious elements to run in
    overdrive.
    - classifying visual signal w/ limited information is especially
      taxing. this exploits
      [Kantian Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(Kant))
      "collapse" which is similar to the wavefunction collapse. Before
      the mind has imbued its experience w/ conceptual designation for
      particular social, sensory or semiotic signal, the brain must
      expend a lot of energy and chaotically divert its energy to
      acquire enough information to trigger the Kantian collapse. It
      triggers turbulence in neural energetic flows.
