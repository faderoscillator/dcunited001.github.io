# Energetic FLows


### Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) And Interstitial Fluid (ISF)

- discuss jim carrey's explanation of CSF flow and how it relates to
  spirituality

- how does ISF differ from CSF?
  - in the VAT(?) what is transferred from the CSF to the ISF (through
    which fluid channels?)
  - much else to refer to here?

### CSF Questions

- what does it absorb in and carry to the spinal, ventricular, and
  cerebellar region?
- what serum components originate in which areas?
- which electrochemical components originate in which areas?

- In which areas does CSF flux depend on:
  - (1) hydrostatic pressure and
    -  to areas which can encourage fluid flow via mechaical motion
  - (2) osmotic pressure
    - the cerebellar/ventricular regions are less "networked" and
      thus, likely rely moreso on osmotic pressure
  - these are my best-educated assumptions

- from a fluid-dynamics perspective, the effect of a backspin (like 10
  rotations) on CSF and blood flow
  - the change in angular momentum sucks at least the blood to the
    crown of your brain.
    - it'd be interesting to know exactly what happens here
  - it's probably almost entirely bloodflow increase, as you tighten
    your core/legs, restricting bloodflow in torso
    - your head stays at mostly the same distance from center, which
      is the region of your body with almost all CSF
      - CSF regions maintain more consistent volume
      - you do crunch your abs, curving your spine inwards though,
        potentially closing the downward flows of CSF, pushing some
        fluid forward to the spine

### Neuroelectrical Energy Flow

- by "neuroelectrical energy flow"
  - i mean to understand the body's energetic flows as they relate to
    the holistic system, not as they correlate centrally to the
    CNS/PNS
  - Peripheral NS, Central NS

- what are the relationships b/w:
  - the surface area of each section of the spinal dermatome,
  - the diameter of the spinal nerves that supply it
  - and the density/quantity of nerve endings it supplies?
  - and the amount of electrical energy its ennervation transmits back
    up through the spine?

### Motion, Compression, Tension and (Joint Compaction)

- how do these active factors affect ISF/CSF?
  - Neuroelectrical Energy Flow?

### Movement of Energy Through the Spine

- afferent/efferent nerves
  - mechanims for feedback/reflex/overstrain

- focus on how energy flows from afferent/efferent nerve bundles in
  the spinal column affect adjacent nerves/bundles
  - is there a local burnout caused by excessive usage of a spinal
    nerve bundle? (ion/atp overconsumption that requires a small
    amount of time to replentish) <?>
    - there is probably not, since the nerves/bundles should be coated
      with myelin sheath through the spine, which helps to insulate
      each from the conduction of others and also should provide a
      cache of nutrition <?>

- are there neural faculties for amplifying signal in the brainstem,
  upper/lower? in the spine? at the spine's connection to the nerves
  exiting it?
  - how tightly did our nervous system adapt to prefer minimization of
    energy consumption? i.e. amplification closer to the motor impulse
    source would be less efficient

- <?> for afferent/afferent nerve signals, most interference or
  cross-modulation, if any, would occur in the brain, around/after the
  places where they pass through corticospinal & corticobulbar regions
  - from here, the brain's networks become more elorately networked
- how does the timing of afferent nerve impulses affect how the brain
  processes them?
  - (need to look at how dermaphores signal)
  - is there some clocking mechanism for sensory impulses? or do
    dermatophores signal on input, immediately passing the impulses
    upstream?
    - if it's something like this latter mechanism, without a clocking
      mechanism near the senses

#### Sleeping/Meditating in Zero-G

- totally random, but whenever your body experiences gravity, it must
  counter by pushing with some muscles in nearly any position you find
  yourself in -- even when laying down
  - in zero-g, you experience nearly zero force on your body in any
    position, unless you're moving/pushing/pulling
    - so, doesn't this make it slightly easier to acheive minimization
      of efferent impulses through the spine?
      - is it also similarly simple to minimize tactile/etc sensory
      impulses over afferent nerves
  - if so, and if it really is a goal of meditation to generally
    diminish spinal nerve signalling (afferent/efferent/etc), then
    does that mean there are novel techniques for meditation in space?

# Physiological Explanations for Spiritual (Practices)

### Yoga

- [Yoga Physiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_physiology)
  - gland stimulation
  - fluid flux through muscles
  - increased local capillary pressure
  - decreased local arterial/vein flow where a yoga posture cuts off
    large veins

### Variance in Local Rates of Flux

- while breathing with high oxygenation, when taking particular
  medications when stimulating your diet with (all-natural food-based)
  supplements, then there will be higher plasma concentrations of
  oxygen, food, nutrition, etc
  - therefore, the *slight* multiplier effect *over the time one holds
    a yoga pose* combines with the effect of plasma concentrations of
    anything carried by the blood
    - or lymph concentrations of anything pumped through the lymphatic
      system. or the ISF/CSF concentrations of anything carried
      through the ISF/CSF systems
    - therefore, higher plasma concentrations of both beneficial and
      toxic substances can be delivered at *slightly higher rates* at
      least *for short periods of time*.
      - with proper breathing technique and proper "capture" of blood
        flow distorion via body posture (pressuring artery/vein) the
        delivers the substances in your blood to focused areas of your
        body. for some capillary networks this can dramatically
        increase the rate of accumulated flux of blood
  - for any research or treatment methods, it is critical to be able
    to measure a posture/sequence's effect on blood flow
    - or lymphatic/ISF/CSF flow

### Designing Specific Posture Sequences and Altering Postures to optimize some effect

- with knowledge of anatomy (esp. of circultory/lyphatic/ISF/CSF
  systems AND glandular systems) physiological fluid-dynamics, then
  one can sequence, time, pace and optimize their poses to trigger
  glandular release of hormones/messengers to the circulatory/etc
  systems at the right time to focus it into a specific region of the
  body
  - this requires an profound understanding of human anatomy, fluid
    dynamics, circ/lymph/isf/csf systems, and of how specific yoga
    poses influence the fluid flows of these systems
  - still, this would be a fascinating basis for many studies on how
    exactly yoga poses can alter fluid dynamics and local accumulated
    flux of circ/lymph/ISF/CSF

### Yoga and Gland Stimulation

- what glands are accessible/safe to modulate with stimulation via
  slight pressure?
  - what would the gland release? specifically how do the glandular
    byproducts build up? if these are hormones/messengers, how do they
    reach their targets?
  - for a gland's specific byproducts, how much and how fast does it
    accumulate them? knowing this and given some destination (usually
    some organ), what sequence of poses would *actually* provide
    stimulation?

- has there been research on yoga poses and gland stimulation?
  - is it possible to measure plasma levels throughout a yoga session
    to see when/if they spike significantly?

### Some of Kundalini Yoga's Movements Are Intended to Drive Spinal CSF Flux

- the subarachnid (...?) space has to respond to spinal motions,
  - for some kundalini movements, additional downward and posterior
    from spinal circumvection seems to be optimized by the design of
    motion

### The Effects of Specific Breathing Techniques

- [Pratiloma Ujjayi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratiloma_ujjayi)
 - at least partially derives its effects from:
   - (1) increased rate of inflow in one nostril with the same
     diaphram movement pulling in more air
   - (2) increased vorticity of air, resulting in turbulence and thus
     greater rates of flux across alvalolae

- [Kapalabhati (Hatha Yoga)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapalabhati_(Hatha_Yoga))

### Qigong's Effects on Neuroelectrical Flow

- after a good session, why does the magnetic sensation emerge?
  - this sensation seems to build up over time and it's as if you can
    feel it and nudge it along while doing the qigong motions

### Accupuncture's Effects on Neuroelectrical Flow

- what effect(s) do they have on neuroelectrical flow?
- what materials have effects? why? what is the electromechanical
  effect on neural flow
- how can imagery help identification of meridiums?
  - automated identification of meridiums from CAT/MRI/imagery?
    - the meridiums do not likely not physical
    - instead may represent some derivative phenomenon that only
      emerges a direct measure

# Qi

- does Qi emerge from a *collectively inductive* magnetic field
  arising from blood flow?
  - do the oxygenated forms of hemoglobin (contribute varying amounts
    of EM to the induced field?)
  - how do nerve impulses and other biomechanical systems contribute
    to the aggregate effect on EMF?

### Studies on Qi?

- machine learning on generalized human anatomy
  - each subject's chi channels either autolabeled (semiunsupervised)
    or labeled (supervised)
  - analyze what contributes

#### Comments on [Facebook Video](https://www.facebook.com/dconner.pro/videos/10204433764840838/)

- lol at my Reiki EnergyWork @ 0:40 and feeling out the Chi in my
  CrownChakra at 1:25.
  - that stuff is crazy there is a biomagnetic Higher-Order Energy
    Field that surrounds your body, generated by the Piezo-Electric
    activity of your bones.
  - QiGong is about pushing this manipulating the fluid-dynamics of
    this higher-order energy field.
- by higher-order, i mean that it can't be directly measured because
  it's the *product* of physical quantities related to kinetic,
  thermodynamic and magnetic factors. still, it can be felt.
  - it becomes much stronger with a diet that includes ~5 glasses of
    green tea per day, minimal acidic diet intake (no soda), and
    raisins/goji berries and other high-ORAC foods.
  - Exercise that raises the oxygenation of your blood helps you
    generate the chi. Once you move it around, it *seems* that your
    brain becomes aquainted with the energy as if it's part of your
    body and seeks to restore the balance while the "fluid" is
    displaced. so the more work you do to "push" around the
    biomagnetic energy, the more the body seeks to scale up the
    processes that produce it.

- Exercise/Movements that compel Cerebro Spinal Fluid(CSF) motion
  cause hormones & other CSF fluid components to be cycled between
  your brain/body faster. The CSF carries it down through the
  ventricles and down the spine in the SAS. If it cycles more, your
  brain can expel waste more quickly and replentish nutrients/hormones
  more effectively (i think).
  - however, cycling the CSF seems to drive the activation &
    development of Chi/Prana/etc. it's fascinating because so many
    people live their entire life without *ever* experiencing this
    once.
