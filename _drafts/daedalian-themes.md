brief discussion on searching for the right medium

universal values
- tales evolve as they spread
- barlaam and josephat
  - evolved from a buddhist parable
  - and gradually into a christian parable

what does style include?
- level of detail, kinds of detail
- literary devices
- flow and form over a short range
- dialogue and how situations that require expository dialogue are
  approached

- the style and form are affected by the medium of the work
- &#x0F3A
- &#x0F3B

### Ergo Proxy Daedalus

#### Chrono Trigger &#x2605; [Richie Branson](https://richiebranson.bandcamp.com/album/from-guardia-with-love) Can Tell You Why

![Chrono Trigger](/img/posts/2016-06-21-if-i-had-the-chops-to-write-my-daedalian-magnum-corpus/chrono-trigger-art.jpg)

#### kaiser soze

- a mixture of form and style
- an impossibly convoluted, elusive character
  - unresolveable ending
  - the myth of kaiser soze feeds into the story ... how?

#### No Longer Human

No Longer Human is told in the form of notebooks left behind by the
main character.
- why did the author choose this style?

#### Gargantua and Pantagruel

- made up words, inspired by ancient greek (need more info)
- tons of wordplay. considered obscene at first, but eventually
  became a staple of french literature
- a particular "scorn for fortuitous things" .... need to expand on
  this

#### Neuromancer

- vivid detail of scenery
  - so much is explored that isn't reused
  - it's almost dreamlike
    - in that imagery arises then fades without consequence to the
      main plot
    - while adding to the atmosphere
  - i always reference this aspect of neuromancer because it stuck out
    to me
    - there was so much revealed about this future culture
      - yet it wasn't enough i was left wanting more

## Specific Themes

(publish as part two?)

include subjects for theme ideas? how to format the list?

### check for dupes & sort

- living for the rest of your life under guilt imparted by false
  presumptions
  - especially when such presumptions can't be refuted because you
    never have a chance to defend yourself for whatever reason

- the importance of a variety of life experiences, especially early on
  - how a lack of certain kinds of early life experiences can lead to
    a lifetime of neuroses or sociopathic behavior
  - one could also be equipped with an improper lens for viewing an
    experience in relation to themselves

- gauging someone's belief system & ethics by testing them
  - the importance of testing someone discreetly.  the wisdom in knowing that
    a test should be unknown to the person being tested. if they know
    that they are being tested and they know that you don't know that
    they know ...
  - the value of more universal models for ethics and virtue
    - if one has a universal model to compare to, it becomes much easier
      to judge someone's character, ethics and virtues
    - in a more decentralized, anarchic system with lots of subcultures,
      very little cultural overlap and lots of variety, it becomes very
      difficult to find someone you trust or to judge someone's
      character

- the value of free information & knowledge, contrasted with the value of
  restrictions on the distribution of some kinds of knowledge

- the definition and value of one's soul

- conservative vs. progressive ideals
  - as they relate to the stability of a culture

### betrayal

- betrayal for supposed self-gain
- epic betrayal borne out of subtle deception
- betrayal of one's mentor or teacher.  betrayal by one's student.

### compassion:

- unparalleled compassion, unknown to the recipient (for whatever
  reason)
  - and unimaginable karmic debt -- the pain of knowing you'll never
    be able to pay it back

### deception

- the perfect deceivers. sociopaths.  those who seem to have a
  penchant for being 4 steps ahead in any possible direction
  - exploring what it takes to be someone like that
    - the costs to one's own personal values and freedoms
    - the subtle (laughable) limitations imposed by that behavior
  - how to expose someone like that
- those who systematically teach the art of deception

### fame

- it's costs and effects on relationships and artistic potential.
  - this theme is well demonstrated through the use of foil
- stars as the embodiment of the metaphysical, like diamonds condensed
  under pressure to the point of super-nova
- escaping the notoriety of fame
- the price of wealth is ___, but the price of fame lasts a lifetime

### fate

- just fate. it's a huge theme.
- being born into situations one has no control over
  - being raised under conditions or towards some end that one has no
    control over.
- cosmic fate vs manifested destiny
- situations which are inevitable, for one reason or another.
  - i.e. overpopulation or technological evolution.

### biases

- dunning krueger effect
  - imposter syndrome
- exploration of biases in general:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases
- automation bias, defined as the tendency to excessively depend on
  automated systems which can lead to erroneous automated information
  overriding correct decisions.
- prejudice
  - prejudice in reverse (assuming someone is prejudiced because of a
    label they can't refute)

### paradox

- list of paradoxes: pick one and write, it's easy
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_paradoxes
- [ship of theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)
  - "whether an object that has had all of its components
    replaced remains fundamentally the same object."

### art

- dilution and over-saturation in 21st century art
- the artist who lives inside his canvas
  - especially with a lack of control over the art

### war

- the true costs of war.
  - personal costs, societal costs & more
- the true causes of war are often obscured or enshrouded
  - the politics behind making war.
  - and the economics driving it.
- staving off a war
  - especially when it is known by a select few to be inevitable
- the value of unity in war.
  - unity in arms, unity in society, unity in support
  - the price of disorder in war
- the danger of threatening military action
- the role of information in war
  - in battle, in strategy, in it's causes
  - the role of trust

### love

- love at first sight, tested
- unrequited love.  ahhh, unrequited love lmao
- forbidden love (a la romeo and juliet .. !@#$ $@# montagues)
- is true love conditional?
- tragic romantic cynicism

### mortality

- immortality (in obscurity)
- egyptian definition of immortality ... (remove??)
  - roman definition of genius
- struggling with mortality, especially when one lacks control of
  legacy
- knowing you'll have to leave your family behind
  - developing a plan after death, a will to be executed
    - a la P.S I love you, but more conventional
- growing up without a parent or as an orphan

### idealism

a few of these themes on idealism interest me more than most of
the others. however, these are also some of the most difficult themes
to explore, as they are very abstract and far removed.  thus, their
implementation into a work is likely to be lost or muddled.  impure
at the very least.  the one that interests me the most is "the imposed
personification of idealism." these are best used as high-level,
over-arching themes in a character-focused work that also covers many
other themes. character-driven works are very difficult to sell bc
nothing really happens and it's really all or nothing.  if people are
very interested in your characters, it sells (as a niche).  if they're not,
you're S.O.L. cuz you don't have enough explosions.

- unrestrained idealism (TODO: elaborate .. lol i forgot)
  - i think i meant the complete lack of pragmatism in the application
    of idealistic beliefs.
- unrewarded virtue & karma
- idealism vs practicality, as they relate to and affects reality
- exploitation of ideals, philosophy, etc (superman vs. batman)
  - the characters who lack loyality to any ideals
    - at all, no ideals
    - except their own
    - except towards their own agenda
    - the chaotic character, who seeks to disrupt whatever (the joker)
    - out of ignorance of ideals
- ==> imposed personification of idealism
  - our desire for our heroes to embody ideals comes at the cost of
    their humanity, for better and worse

### wisdom:

- the value of a simple, humble life chosen over greatness
- the dangers of intellectual masturbation
  - yeh, it's bad. you'll go blind.
  - some good ideas are just fun to think about, but have a propensity
    for going horribly wrong. people may misunderstand your intent,
    which was truly motivated by intellectual curiosity and from
    desire to demonstrate the dangers.
- confusing intense intellectual curiousity with actual desire to
  experience something.
  - knowing something is an interesting idea, but one that is loaded
    with many consequences (both pos. & neg.)
  - and loaded with debt, obligation & responsibility
  - but yourself and others confuse this curiosity & interest to know
    with a genuine desire to know or desire to experience.
- the value in determining your own life experience.  how one might
  develop a particular strategy for doing so
- be careful what you wish for
- aversion of catastrophy through the creation of minor conflict to
  encourage cooperation
- what is the cost/price of happiness?  the price/cost of love?
- the wisdom of not knowing
  - when you don't know something, you don't have to worry about
    reacting to knowledge about it.
  - also, if human interaction is partly driven by a desire to share
    knowledge, but you already know everything, then that leaves you
    in a position where you never really need anyone else
- the self-similarity in everything

### memory

- its nature as ephemeral, fleeting and malleable
- it's value as something treasures, yet worthless
- suppressed memories' effect on subconsious and conscious thoughts
  - the unshakable feeling that there is "something missing"
  - the development of aggregate memories and memories based on the
    artificial presence or absence of memorials
  - what it feels like when the mind is confused when the truth is
    revealed.  the aggregate memories still exist and need to be
    reconciled.  the mind starts forming new memories based on the
    difference between realities.  this is very confusing.
    - the mind has a propensity to create associate new memories with
      prior events, even when there is no association.  this is
      probably because there are a high rate of memories being formed
      based on recently reacquired memories.  this is VERY confusing.
      - not that anyone seems to care
- suggesting/contorting memories
- types of memory:
  - exploring the phenomenalogical subtleties of memories formed via
    various types of senses
  - procedural memory.
- subtleties in behavioral change exhibited by characters with
  neurological abnormalities, especially those who have deficits in
  memory
- memory loss as a blessing and a curse
  - this could be exhibited in many different ways (and has been)
  - a character gets amnesia and loses a portion or an entireity of
    their memory.
    - sometimes, the best thing we can do is forget.
  - or a character can't form new memories.  how does this affect
    their behavior?
  - a character lacks short-term memory.
- induced memory loss as a tool or weapon.
- transferred memory and other astral curiousities
  - unintentially transferred memories.  residual memory.
  - accessing other people's thoughts or memories via the astral plane
  - memory encoded in genetics

### freedom/salvation

- desperately trying to save someone (secretly) who is obstensibly
  trying to save you.
- trying to save someone from themselves
  - from the weight of previous experiences & memories
  - or from the weight of their dreams/ambitions
    - freedom from desire/attachment
- forsaking the path to true enlightenment/salvation
  - for love or debt or obligation, etc

### philosophy

- using post-structuralism to fight the inevitability of structuralism
  - especially through the usage of higher-order logic
    - explore the chaos of such systems embracing such logic (symbolism)
- the true nature of the world seems to be that most are trapped in a
  blissfully ignorant realm,
  - unaware of greater realms that surround it, which are unknown and
    almost unknowable.
  - a lucky few happen to miraculously break through or ascend.
  - these upper realms seem to create/drive the phenomena that
    manifest in the lower realms.
- the illusion of knowledge in the information age.
  - less and less "universal" knowledge, proportionally
  - that is, knowledge that is purely "constructive", a nod to
    constructive mathematics)
    - as opposed to intuinistic systems, which are valid only under
      the contexts which created them.  these become nothing but a
      waste of neurons after the contexts the create them crumble
      (i.e. does anyone want to learn to repair a VCR?)
- in contrast, the relevance and value of information in the digital
  age. (a la information warfare)
- metaphysical connection that transcend language
- transcending time
- the cyclical nature of time
- the universiality of life experience
- turing-complete sentient-being composed of metaphysical elements
  - that exists only in the minds of men
  - a self-replicating mind-machine that can only be destroyed once all
    the pieces of it have been destroyed (like horcruxes)

### history

... need to expound on this

- the nature of history

### self-discovery

- as provoked by tragic life experiences
- unrecognized genius.
- who makes the makers.  that is, what kind of artist makes an artist?
  can these things be made?  and the knowledge some higher level
  artist must have: what is it and how can it be obtained?  if the
  knowledge of how to be an artist is something that can be imparted,
  then what of the knowledge of how to be an artist that trains artists
- the unknown treasure carried with us all along.
  - the guilt and distress experienced when you realize you let down
    the person who imparted you with such a jewel. you failed the
    person who appears to have loved you the most, though secretly.
  - the frustration experienced, when you know that there were so many
    people who worked hard to ensure things would end up exactly this
    way. and you know exactly how they interfered to screw things up.
    - but no one cares.
    - and no one intends to give you a chance to openly defend yourself

### myth:

- humanity's need for myth (what if myth were real?)
  - what does a story have to offer society?
  - does it's value descend from it's truth, if purported as such?
    - that is, does a story purportedly true lose it's value
      when proven wrong? yes
- what is the value of a story? and the truth?
  - does it's value outweigh the cost in consequence of telling it?
  - does its value diminish by telling everyone?
  - can anyone be trusted to tell the story truthfully? even when it
    appears everyone knows all they need to know?
  - what about the legacy of a story, will the story remain true to
    itself after the author has passed for many years or generations?
- encoding the truth in fiction (it draws on higher-order logic)
- the power of a story as a motivational force

### power:

- obsession with power in the name of security can bring about
  disaster in itself
- knowledge of the rules of power is like fire.
  - it is useful when controlled, but spreads quickly and destructively
- the duty & responsibility coupled to influence, wealth and power
  - specifically, examples demonstrating failure to abide by these
    duties.
  - unspoken rules that accompany power, wealth and influence

### misunderstanding

- lost in translation: hidden meanings & undelivered messages
- persistance of self-delusion in fear of losing a fantasy far greater
  than "reality" (especially when said delusion was real and the fear
  of delusion unnecessary)
- unnecessary tragedy arising from fear and confusion resulting from
  unknowns, lack of communication, & response to trauma
  - the mistaken pursuit of justice & it's costs
  - the delimma of sacrificing another for one's own purposes or sense
    of justice
- imposed silence in a situation where everyone sees all your thoughts
  and words. self-censorship
- omega-bable: dialects and microlanguages created between small
  groups or even pairs of people.  what is their power?
  - what happens when this connection disintegrates permanence

### temptation:

- when you are tempted into action by enemies, who desire to trap you
  - story where nehemiah? was tempted to flee to the temple for safety
    - but it was a trick because only priests are allowed in there
  - your enemies are slyly trying (in private) to put you in a position
    that later will by publicly disastrous
  	- and then the blame for it is cast on you, as little as you may or
  	  may not have had with it
  - often, if one is to be attacked in this way, the offense will be
    judged very loudly (because the point is to burn you with it)
    and it will often end up being trivial (it is
    usually something which can be disregarded and thus it's a mistake
    that people will often make)
  - when one is burnt anyways even though they chose the high road
    - joseph? & the queen

### fear:

- the opportunity cost of ruling those around you with fear
  - i.e. we lose opportunities we might never know by grasping
    and seeking to fearfully control everything around us
- TODO: more themes about fear

### misc:

- the inherant cost of accepting a gift
- paradise lost
- our unknown battles
- the virtues and evils of psychopomps
  - prometheus, fire & immortality
  - the trickster tricks the devil
  - the archetypical mystic disguised as a beggar
- the idiot savant whose battles are won through serendipity, luck and purity
  - the nature of such serendipity
    - especially as contrasted with the sociopath's meticulous planning
      and strategic, obsequious behavior
- the abstraction of knowledge, communication & action
  - how signs and symbols evolve and signify, sometimes secretly, the
    status of some condition to others (adherents of religions, etc)
  - can decentralized metaphysical entities exist and what is their
    effect on our world?  how can such a thing be fought?
- the value of credit for genius/creativity
  - if there truly is a cost to fame/recognition resulting from
    genius/creativity, what would happen if that cost were no longer
    there?
- being pigeon-holed by buridan's ass
  - your ethics and psychology is assessed and you're placed in a
    situation with options that induce inaction, either because they're
    all highly desireable or they're all highly indesireable in some way

### leadership:

- TODO: themes about leadership
- personal sacrifices & opportunity costs
- tough choices made for political gain as a leader
- the best leaders are those who lead without a title
- the best leaders are those who lead by example
- the politics of leadership
  - especially the indirect & required political moves
    - which, at best, seem tangential or orthogonal to your stated goals
    - and to many might seem contrary to your goals
    - or exploited by your enemies as examples of your inconsistency or immorality
- law needs to be enforce rigidly

### sacrifice

- muted martydom, where one makes some sacrifice, but can't tell anyone
  else about it
  - especially martydom which indirectly affects the change you want
    though via a course of action which leaves oneself tainted
- sacrificing one's own individuality
  - for a greater cause
  - or for the next generation

### trust

- a need for reliance on trusting those who could hurt you most
  - especially when you should not trust them (and possibly know this)
  - what would cause someone to find themselves in such a situation?
  - perhaps it's just a relationship where trust is damaged.
    - when you have a *need* to rely on them how does the damaged
      trust affect your behavior?

### isolation:

- ironic, self-imposed, etc.
  - through various aspects and causes
- isolation imposed by intelligence, talent, and/or non-conformity
  - explore the reasons why such traits would lead to isolation
  - if thirst for knowledge drives our need to communicate, what does
    this mean for a world where everyone knows everything?
    - does it mean that it is considered more or less valuable to have
      knowledge or information?
    - how does this lead to a change in attitudes towards investing
      time in acquiring knowledge
- the effect of artificially imposed and protracted isolation.  how
  would this affect a character?  distinguish between those characters
  who would prefer isolation, or those who maybe deserve it.
  - could someone be socially isolated to the point where they feel
    like they might as well be in jail? probably
- the pain of a neurodegenerative disease, particularly one that is
  undiagnosed.  symptoms are often behavioral and drive others away
  who might've understood, had the disease been obvious.
- limitations imposed by classism
- isolation via technology through social network manipulation and
  shadowy government agencies

### justice/karma

- strict adherence to truth & virtue as panacea to deception
  - especially when done so out of ignorance
  - when naivety elucidates innocence, revealing deception to all
    - socratic method
- causality and guilt: if ignorance is bliss, how does knowledge
  affect our Karma (intent/knowledge/consequences)
- justice dispensed secretly, through conspiracy.
  - i plead the 6th
- appearances, reality and hypocrisy
- lacking the information to ethically consider the consequences of
  one's prior or future actions
- various definitions of karma:
  - universal, mystic karma
  - the practical karma accrued through the aggregate perception of
    one's own actions by those around him/her


# Story Ideas

### Unknown Hemlock

- Socrates & Unknown Hemlock (surreptitious administration of a drug)
  - socrates instead realizes he can continue to live while being
    medicated w/o consent, but doesn't want to, since it numbs his
    mind.
  - he instead find the location of the surreptitiously medicated
    food/drink and decides to overdose on it, making it the fault of
    those he was in care of.
  - since it was secret to mostly everyone, the toxicology report
    comes as a major surprise.
- {after getting surreptitiously medicated, i am almost certain. it
  was something that was not }

### How to Convey (future) Loss Without Words

- A lady who's never managed to live her life but miraculously had
  kids after being told it was impossible.
  - her cancer returns again and again. she knows she's terminally
    ill, yet her & her husband don't want to tell their daughter {2-3
    y/o}
    - i need to know a lot more about developmental psychology of
      children at this age before i could decide
  - she loves her daughter very much but wants to use her own death as
    a means to teach her daughter about loss
    - true, painful loss because she doesn't know how to best use her
      last months/years w/ her family & her daughter is too young to
      understand life/death.
  - is this a realistic interpretation? was it?
  - topics of themes: mortality, life, and beginning/end of life
    - deciding what to do with her last few months. planning on either
      trying to explain it to her daughter or making the most of it,
      so that it means more, but is a heavier loss at the same time.
  - how does this family decide to do this? why does she decide to do
    this? and what kind of experiences has the mother had through her
    life to lead her to make this decision?
    - why is it different than what other parents might do? is it that
      different?
      - {perhaps she and her husband are slightly older and hadn't had
        kids yet, so she has a different take on life & never expected
        to have a kid, but always wanted one}
  - {this situation played out beside me at the coffee shop. as i'm
    typing this note in, i mostly only remember how profound it was
    when it happened, but I'm trying to remember why}
    - i could tell she was sick and i knew her daughter didn't know. i
      didn't leer or stare or anything, but that's what came
      across. when i realized this i immediately became overwhelmingly
      sad. i may have had to get up from my table.
      - it was the way the daughter responded to something
